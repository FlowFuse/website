## HubSpot

We use [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) to track and manage all of our customer interactions.
It enables the creation of customer contacts, and then logging of emails/notes associated to that customer.

### Creating Contacts

Given that we have multiple client-facing roles within FlowForge, it's important to document those that
we talk to to ensure no crossover in sales and conversations.

It is best practice to ensure a HubSpot contact is created prior to meeting with them, as soon as a
call/conversation is scheduled.

This minimises the chances of another FlowForge colleague arranging a
conversation with that same contact, and will make it clear to others in the team, whom you're planning to
talk to. In some cases, we may have had interactions with potential FlowForge customers in the past, and
other colleagues can contribute useful information upfront of any new introductions.

#### Lifecycle Stage

When defining a new contact in HubSpot, an option exists to define the "Lifecycle Stage", this section
details your options here, and when to use the respective value:

| Lifecycle Stage|Description
| - | - |
| Subscriber | Contact has signed up to hear more information, when it is available, about FlowForge, e.g. newsletter subscriber |
| Lead | Contact that has converted on our website, or through some other interaction, with our organisation beyond a subscription sign up, e.g. installed FlowForge locally, or signed up for a free trial |
| Marketing Qualified Lead | Contact that the Marketing Team has qualified as being ready for a Sales Engagement. |
| Sales Qualified Lead | Contact that the Sales team has qualified as a potential customer. This stage is then further qualified in the [Lead Status](#lead-status) property |
| Opportunity | Contact with which a member of FlowForge is actively negotiating a deal. |
| Customer | An active, paying, user of FlowForge. |
| Evangelist | Someone that speaks on behalf of FlowForge, or advocates for its usage in their respective contacts ecosystems. |
| Other | Does not fit into any of the other descriptions, likely someone we are talking to about FlowForge, but will never be a paying customer, .e.g. Partners |

#### Lead Status

When defining a new contact in HubSpot, an option exists to define the "Lead Status", this section
details your options here, and when to use the respective value:

| Lead Status | Description |
| - | - |
| None | - |
| Attempted to Contact | A member of FlowForge has reached out to this contact, but is yet to receive a response. |
| Connected | Two-way conversation has undertaken, but not yet qualified as a Lead. A lead with this status may still be waiting on a booked meeting with a decision-maker on their team or may still be working to establish a budget. |
| Open Deal | Contact has expressed interest in buying FlowForge, and negotiations are actively open. |
| Unqualified | Contact is no longer interested in FlowForge. |


### Recommended Apps

We have several extension applications for HubSpot, these are a few that can be beneficial if you're interacting with customers:

- **G-Mail Extension ([link](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/ecosystem/26586079/marketplace/apps/sales/sales-enablement/gmail))** - Automatically creates contacts when you e-mail them for the first time, and logs e-mail activity against that contact in HubSpot.
