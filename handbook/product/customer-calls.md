### Customer calls

FlowForge is fortunate to have a community the size of Node-REDs community. The
product organisation should constantly be in touch with the community to
understand their challenges, current solutions, and learn why they have or
haven't adopted FlowForge.

For each call document all the learnings to share internally, to start; make a
copy of [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_gya2WZTJW0G2CxlsJguLDCJI3eHRILJzd9ICsn5QTs)
and roughly follow the questions listed.
