# Vendors

### Process

To start to process of approval and paying of invoices a PDF of the invoice should
be mailed to billing@flowforge.com. FlowForge pays invoices 30 days after filing 
unless specifically agreed otherwise prior to filing the invoice.

The invoice should include:
- Vendor Invoice ID
- Vendor address
- Vendor contact details
- Details of services rendered
- Amount of dollars due

#### Fraud prevention

We do not diverge from this process regardless of the urgency of the payment. We will _never_ make a payment request through direct email or text messages.

If in any doubt, reach out through Slack and request a call to validate.
