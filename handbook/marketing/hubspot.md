## HubSpot

We use [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) to track and manage all of our customer interactions.
It enables the creation of customer contacts, and then logging of emails/notes associated to that customer.

### Creating Contacts

Given that we have multiple client-facing roles within FlowForge, it's important to document those that
we talk to to ensure no crossover in sales and conversations.

#### Lifecycle Stage

When defining a new contact in HubSpot, an option exists to define the "Lifecycle Stage", this section
details your options here, and when to use the respective value:

| Lifecycle Stage|Description
| - | - |
| Subscriber | Contact has signed up to hear more information, when it is available, about FlowForge, e.g. newsletter subscriber |
| Lead | Contact that has converted on our website, or through some other interaction, with our organisation beyond a subscription sign up, e.g. installed FlowForge locally, or signed up for a free trial |
| Marketing Qualified Lead | Contact that the Marketing Team has qualified as being ready for a Sales Engagement. |
| Sales Qualified Lead | Contact that the Sales team has qualified as a potential customer. This stage is then further qualified in the [Lead Status](#lead-status) property |
| Opportunity | Contact with which a member of FlowForge is actively negotiating a deal. |
| Customer | An active, paying, user of FlowForge. |
| Evangelist | Someone that speaks on behalf of FlowForge, or advocates for its usage in their respective contacts ecosystems. |
| Other | Does not fit into any of the other descriptions, likely someone we are talking to about FlowForge, but will never be a paying customer, .e.g. Partners |

#### Lead Status

When defining a new contact in HubSpot, an option exists to define the "Lead Status", this section
details your options here, and when to use the respective value:

| Lead Status | Description |
| - | - |
| None | - |
| Attempted to Contact | A member of FlowForge has reached out to this contact, but is yet to receive a response. |
| Connected | Two-way conversation has undertaken, but not yet qualified as a Lead. A lead with this status may still be waiting on a booked meeting with a decision-maker on their team or may still be working to establish a budget. |
| Open Deal | Contact has expressed interest in buying FlowForge, and negotiations are actively open. |
| Unqualified | Contact is no longer interested in FlowForge. |


### Recommended Apps

We have several extension applications for HubSpot, these are a few that can be beneficial if you're interacting with customers:

- **G-Mail Extension ([link](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/ecosystem/26586079/marketplace/apps/sales/sales-enablement/gmail))** - Automatically creates contacts when you e-mail them for the first time, and logs e-mail activity against that contact in HubSpot.
