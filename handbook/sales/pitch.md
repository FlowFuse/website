## Pitch

Through the rapid growth of connected devices in IoT and new SaaS offerings
being launched each day, the cost to integrate them is growing more than
exponentially. Not integrating services isnâ€™t an option, competitors will
achieve higher operational efficiencies and outcompete you.

Node-RED is the most deployed open source integration platform to connect
IT (internet technology) and OT (operational technology). 

Bringing Node-RED to production creates toil, and the effectiveness of Node-RED
drops due to open questions around security, deployment, and collaboration.
FlowForge has taken all those worries and ensures peace of mind around
everything Node-RED. Focus on integrating all your systems with each other,
operational technology to your IT systems and back again, while FlowForge brings
your flows to production.
