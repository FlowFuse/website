# Performance Review

In September a performance review is done for all employees. The performance
review is based on [our values](../company#values) and meeting role
expectations. A review is held by the direct manager of each employeee. The
manager will write down their expectations, where these were met and where the
employee can still grow. This text is shared with each individual employee.

While this performance review is written down, each manager should've communicated
feedback regularly to minimize the chance for surprises during the written review.

Performance review might influence the [compensation adjustment](../peopleops/compensation#adjustment).
