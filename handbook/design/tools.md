## Tools

If you ever require a license to one of the following tools (where applicable), then please read our [licensing](../peopleops#software-licenses) section in order to attain one.

### Figma ([more info](https://www.figma.com/))

Figma is used to construct mid- and high-fidelity designs. We have two primary working documents for design iterations:

- Website
- Platform

Underlying each of these Figma files is a standardised component library, which coincides with FlowForge's `forge-ui-component` library.

### FigJam ([more info](https://www.figma.com/figjam/))

Figjam, a sister-product of Figma, is a cloud-hosted white boarding tool that enables remote, digital collaboration. 

Any in-person whiteboard discussions should have a documented digital copy. Additionally, FigJam can be used to host and run digital workshops.


### Adobe Creative Cloud ([more info](https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud.html))

For visual design elements of the user interface and public-facing material, we predominantly use Adobe Illustrator and Adobe After Effects.

- **Illustrator** provides us tooling to create high-quality, static SVG assets to supplement the user experience on both the website and the FlowForge platform.

- **After Effects** enables the generation of animated SVG elements. In particular, we work with [Lottie Files](https://lottiefiles.com/) for injection into both our website and FlowForge platform.

Other tools included in the Creative Cloud suite that may be useful include:

- **Photoshop** can be used for raster image and photo-editing.

- **Premiere Pro** is an excellent video-editing software.

### Blender ([more info](https://blender.org))

Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset. It can be used to create static renders of 3d assets, or entire 2d & 3d animations.
