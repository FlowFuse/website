### Website

- All written content should be in UK English.
- All page titles should summarise the content, keep the URL length as short as practical and use [Kebab Case](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kebab_case).
- All images should use informative [alt tags](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/tips/) which clearly describe the point of an image rather than all the details. Alt tags should be no longer than 60 characters.
- When mentioning [FlowForge Concepts](https://flowforge.com/docs/user/concepts/) (terminology) where possible we should link to an explanation of that concept.
- All written content should use the [Oxford Comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma). We believe the Oxford Comma reduces the ambiguity of written technical content.
