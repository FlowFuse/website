## Development

### How we work

- [Packaging](../development/packaging.md) 

## Releases

Instructions for creating a release are [here](../development/release.md)

### Cadence

FlowForge is released every four weeks, on a Thursday. There's 13 releases each
year. The initial release is scheduled for the 20th of January. This implies:

v0.2 is scheduled for 2022/02/17

v0.3 is scheduled for 2022/03/17

### Retrospective

The day after each FlowForge release, always a Friday, a meeting is scheduled
by the CTO. This meeting includes 3 parts: a retrospective on the last release,
complete scheduling for the next release, and kick off development for the next
release.

### Launch Lunch

To celebrate the launch of a new version of FlowForge, we organize a lunch on the
release day. Each team member is encouraged to order a lunch (Expensable up to 20$
per launch) and join a social lunch zoom call.
