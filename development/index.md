## Development

### How we work

- [Packaging](../development/packaging.md)

## Releases

Instructions for creating a release are [here](../development/release.md)

### Cadence

FlowForge is released every four weeks, on a Thursday. There's 13 releases each
year. The initial release is scheduled for the 20th of January. This implies:

v0.2 is scheduled for 2022/02/17

v0.3 is scheduled for 2022/03/17

### Planning

We use GitHub issues for planning the work in a release. A Milestone should exist
for the current release (N) and the next one (N+1). We do not schedule work beyond
that as priorities can change through a release.

There are three types of issue used for planning work:

 - **Epic**: a significant feature or piece of work that doesn't easily fit into
   a single release. It will typically have a number of Stories
   and/or Tasks associated with it that can be delivered iteratively.

 - **Story**: a *user-oriented* description of a feature. It should describe what
   a user should be able to do and identify the value that brings to the user.
   A story should be deliverable in a single release.

 - **Task**: a piece of work that isn't necessarily tied to a specific Epic or Story.
   For example, items related to technical debt or house-keeping chores.

A planning meeting is held at the start of the release. In this meeting the team
discuss the current backlog of stories, tasks and bugs to propose items to be added
to the release. All items assigned to a milestone should have an assigned owner.

### Retrospective

The day after each FlowForge release, always a Friday, a meeting is scheduled
by the CTO. This meeting includes 3 parts: a retrospective on the last release,
complete scheduling for the next release, and kick off development for the next
release.

### Launch Lunch

To celebrate the launch of a new version of FlowForge, we organize a lunch on the
release day. Each team member is encouraged to order a lunch (Expensable up to 20$
per launch) and join a social lunch zoom call.
