## Collecting Signatures

FlowFuse uses Hubspot for generating quotes, and requesting the signatures on
them. For other legal documents we're using
[Google eSignatures](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/12315692?hl=en).

## Subscription agreement

For self-managed licenses FlowFuse has a standard
[subscription agreement template](/handbook/sales/subscription-agreement-1.5/).
When a customer sends over their Standard terms before signing the subscription
agreement, we have a
[standard response overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1US_eixmRtzzFHybl3l9woP0isrwvK2_t7nPXoKYiuq4/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.w8522tz1d0cr).

## Accepted Payment Methods

For self-service customers, Stripe handles the payments with a variaty of
methods. For Enterprise customers, FlowFuse accepts the following payment
methods for vendor payments:

- ACH (Automated Clearing House) bank transfers
- Credit and debit card payments
- Wire transfers

FlowFuse does not accept checks or other paper-based payment methods.

## Professional Services agreement

When a customer requires FlowFuse's professional services, this is the
[Professional Services Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OsasRHu208IOarTiZXp_xLshJX7IKJqfTztgzgovCIA).

## Partnership agreement

For partners who primarily identify potential opportunities and introduce
FlowFuse to new clients, we offer a referral partnership program. In this model,
once a referral is made and acknowledged, FlowFuse takes the lead in managing
the sales cycle and the ongoing customer relationship, compensating the partner
for the successful referral. For the contract this is considered a "Direct"
customer for the partnership agreement.

Furthermore, Value-Added Resellers (VARs) and System Integrators (SIs) are
crucial to our ecosystem. These partners often integrate FlowFuse into broader
solutions and deployment projects for their clients. They serve as the primary
support contact for the end-user, backed by FlowFuse's expertise for escalated
support issues, managing the commercial transaction with the end customer. For
the partnership agreement, these are considered "Indirect" customers, to which
VARs and SIs might sublicense FlowFuse to.

The partnership agreement is provided to the counter party through the Account
Executive. They can share our
[standard referral agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hlmu75o-QG6OsSoBG60v6c0uUMUi98Mz).

## Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)

FlowFuse has templates for standard NDA's:

- [One way NDA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r6a3qgYrfKwNnNwQwx2Wp63QiC_sHGHYca8f9IR_fCI) -
  When the other parties cannot share to any third parties
- [Mutual NDA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YiOQPbcEwbqpLcnrYjaui9ur1iLO_8Y3Ty4TOVJNiTk) -
  Neither party can discuss details outside of the listed parties

If you need these for any discussions, please ask the PeopleOps Manager to send
them to the CEO and the counterparty.

Signed NDA documents should be stored on the
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1BT1KY7B18N4JWlVGEnRsovhwiGnZkm5F)
for future reference.
