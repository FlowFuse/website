## Proof of Concept

### Cloud trial

If the prospect would like to trial FlowFuse Cloud, they are able to self-service at https://app.flowfuse.com/account/create. This will give them a 14-day trial of the Pro tier. If they would like to test with Enterprise features, you can apply a coupon code to their Stripe account and elevate their Tier, after they create their trial account.

#### Extending a trial

To extend the trial period, including if a trial has expired already, use the 'Extend Trial' button on the Team Settings page. This is only available to platform Administrators. If you do not have admin access, raise a [CloudProject change request](https://github.com/FlowFuse/CloudProject/issues/new?assignees=&labels=change-request&projects=&template=change-request.yml&title=Change%3A+) with details.

### Self-hosted trial

If a self-hosted trial is desired, you need to [generate a license key](/handbook/sales/meetings/poc/#generating-a-license) to unlock paid-for features.
Every self-hosted POC call should have an engineer present.

### POC Criteria

During the initial POC meeting, the [POC Criteria document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dr5S9b9dm7Zn84rx-xV9_AvpEwjUPxSk8ZfQDBgpBgQ/edit) should be completed by both FlowFuse and the prospective customer. This ensures both parties are clear about what needs to be technically validated and what the next steps are after the testing is complete.

### Generating a license

- Generate one by [filling out this form](https://energetic-sanderling-4472.flowfuse.cloud/dashboard/license).
- Trial license expiry date should be set for 30 days, even in cases where longer than 30 days may be warranted.
- Include 10 users, 10 teams, and 10 Node-RED instances on the Enterprise Tier.
- Trial extensions need to be approved by management.

All generated licenses are added [to this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wM_o8IWjjkwi-WMRueKfS-lrmkQYzV83xm4BIzZNAO0) automatically.
