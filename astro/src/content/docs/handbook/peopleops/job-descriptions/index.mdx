title: Job Descriptions
---

At FlowFuse, job descriptions are the first step in hiring. They are an important tool in helping manage expectations with candidates on what role they're applying for and, because like all other documents, are kept up-to-date in the handbook, they also become the basis for performance reviews. 

Job Descriptions have a few standard parts to them:
* Job Description- an overview of the role and the resposibilities that we will expect this candidate to fulfill
* Skills- requirements and nice-to-have experience sets of candidates; we never expect a candidate to have 100% of the requirements
* 90 Day Plan- (technically a 13 week plan) expectations for onboarding and how a candidate can expect their first 3 months to go 
* About FlowFuse- this is our chance to sell candidates on why they want to work here; this is not required in the handbook, just on the actual job posting
* Hiring Plan- what will the interview path for this candidate look like

There may be other fields or add-ons included in the job posting via Greenhouse that may not be in the job description in the handbook, inlcuding geographic or timezone requirements, salary ranges, or other details specific to that particular hire that are not specific to the role.
