title: Code of Conduct
---

The primary goal of our Code of Conduct is to foster inclusive, collaborative,
and safe working conditions for all FlowFuse staff and community members who
participate in our open core projects.

As such, FlowFuse is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
environment regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity,
socioeconomic status, or religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for the FlowFuse community, as
well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Scope 

The Code of Conduct applies to all FlowFuse staff. This includes employees
and contractors at every seniority level. It also applies to contributors who
engage with our open core projects.

The Code of Conduct is to be upheld during all professional functions and events,
including but not limited to:

 - Working remotely and communicating on FlowFuse resources with other team members.
 - At FlowFuse-related extracurricular activities and events.
 - While attending conferences and other professional events on behalf of FlowFuse.
 
We expect all FlowFuse staff to abide by this Code of Conduct in all business
matters -- online and in-person -- as well as in all one-on-one communications
with customers and staff pertaining to FlowFuse business.

This Code of Conduct also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the
scope of business activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely
affect the safety and well-being of FlowFuse staff and clients.

## Culture and Belonging

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open community by
encouraging participants to recognize the relationships between our actions and
their effects within FlowFuse culture.

At the core are our [company values](../company/values.md). This Code of Conduct
makes explict how we should behave whilst uphold our values.

 - [**Be inclusive**](../company/values.md#👥-collaborative-community). We strive
   to be a company that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
 - [**Be considerate**](../company/values.md#🤝-customer-empathy). Your work at
   FlowFuse will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the
   work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and
   you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
 - **Be respectful**. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
   no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We expect everyone to remain polite
   and to keep conversations healthy and constructive. We do not allow our frustrations
   to turn in [personal attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem).

## Acceptable and Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all FlowFuse staff:

 - Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the
   health and longevity of FlowFuse.
 - Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions at all times.
 - Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 - Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
 - Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert FlowFuse
   leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations
   of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

 - Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.
 - Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, [ableist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
 - Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
 - Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
 - Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
 - Inappropriate photography or recording.
 - Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them in any manner.
 - Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.
 - Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
 - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
 - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
 - Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any FlowFuse staff, including those with
decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a staff member engages in unacceptable behavior, FlowFuse leadership may take
any action deemed appropriate, up to and including suspension or termination.

## Reporting Violations

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,
please notify an appropriate member of FlowFuse leadership (Peopleops manager, CTO, and/or CEO) as soon as possible.

It is a violation of this policy to retaliate against any person making a
complaint of Unacceptable Behavior or against any person participating in the
investigation of (including testifying as a witness to) any such allegation. Any
retaliation or intimidation may be subject to punitive action up to and including
termination.

## Disciplinary Action

Employees who violate this policy may face disciplinary consequences in proportion
to their violation. FlowFuse management will determine how serious an employee's
offense is and take the appropriate action.
