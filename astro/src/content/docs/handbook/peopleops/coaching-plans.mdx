---

A Coaching Plan is tool for managers to aid in development of their team
members, helping them grow in their role and improve their performance through a
structured plan to be completed with the managers mentorship. Unlike
[Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs)][pip], coaching plans are proactive, focus
on growth, and come without the formal burden of a PIP. 

## Purpose and Philosophy

Coaching plans are built on the principle that all team members have potential
for growth. Either in their job skills, company value alignment, or the
operational execution of their role. Coaching plans are a positive force that
will be deployed for team members to prepare them for career advancement, job
role changes, and other changes.

## When to Use a Coaching Plan

A coaching plan should be initiated by a team members manager when:

- A team member shows potential for growth
- The growth area is specific and coachable
- The identified area for growth isn't a role deficiency, and a [PIP][pip] is in
  order
  - Minor performance areas need attention but don't warrant formal PIP
    intervention
- A team member expresses interest in expanding their responsibilities or transitioning to a new role with additional responsibilities
- The team member is to be prepared for future role progression
- You observe behaviors or skills that could benefit from focused development

  advancement or addressing problems before they grow too big

## Creating a Coaching Plan

### Identify the Opportunity

Managers should:

- Observe areas where the employee could grow or develop
- Consider the employee's career aspirations and interests
- Assess skills that would benefit from strengthening
- Identify opportunities that align with business needs
- Discuss and align with their own manager on the growth opportunity

### Develop the Coaching Plan

The coaching plan should include:

1. Development area: What skill or such is to be improved.
1. Current state: Managers' assesment of the current level.
1. Goal state: A [SMART goal][smart] goal to collectly aim for. This is the result that you're aiming for.
1. Activities: What actions, training, experience are to be done to achieve the
   set goal. This is the inputs to the goal. Team members should be active participants in trying to craft the activities. A manager's proposal in the coaching plan is just a proposal. 
1. Timeline: Start and end date, typically 30 days apart.
1. Support assets: What tools, meeting, or manager assitances will be provided
1. Update Cadence: How manager and team member align on progress, and how to
   collectively achieve goals.

## Documentation and Tracking

While coaching plans are less formal than PIPs, it's important to:

- Document the coaching plan and goals
- Track progress and development activities
- Note feedback and adjustments made
- Record achievements and milestones
- Maintain confidentiality while sharing appropriate updates with HR and
  management
  - Coaching plans are only shared with: the team member, manager, the managers'
    manager, and HR
