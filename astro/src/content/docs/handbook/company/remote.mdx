FlowFuse is fully remote and our team spans multiple countries and timezones.
Working remotely can require some changes.

## Working from a Coworking space

Not everyone wants to sit at home during work, it's recommended to work at least
one day a week outside of home. To accommodate this, you can
[expense a coworking space](../peopleops/expenses#coworking-space-allowance).

## Separating work from private life

Its advised to separate work and private life as much as possible. Now there's
less of a physical barrier, it's more important to create this barrier on the
digital world. Turn off notification outside of your intended working hours for
email, Slack, and GitHub where possible.

While FlowFuse allows you to use your work devices for private purposes, this
is another venue to explore. It might work out better to have a private devices
without any work related data to have access to work when not working.
