title: Markdown Guide
---

This is a very short reference guide for those trying to write Markdown. For more
comprehensive guides, we recommend looking at:

 - [Markdown Guide's Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
 - [GitHub's Getting Started with Markdown Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Header

```md
# First-Tier Header
## Second-Tier Header
### Third-Tier Header
#### Fourth-Tier Header
```

## Paragraph

Hello There, this is a paragraph that is split over
multiple lines in the source, but displays as a single
formatted paragraph.

To start a new paragraph, we separate it with a blank line
from the previous paragraph.

```md

```

## List - Bullet Points

- this is a bullet point list
- this is another item in the list

```md
- this is a bullet point list
- this is another item in the list
```


## List - Numbered

1. this is a numbered list
2. this is another item in the list

```md
1. this is a numbered list
2. this is another item in the list
```

To prevent reordering and keeping count, Markdown allows you to use non-sequencial numbers:

```
1. Item one
1. Item two
```

1. Item one
1. Item two

## Text Format - Italic

*this will be italic*

```md
*this will be italic*
```

## Text Format - Italic

**this will be bold**

```md
**this will be bold**
```

## Links

[this will be a link](http://example.com/)

```md
[this will be a link](http://example.com/)
```

## Images

A picture speaks a thousand words, to include an image in your content it's like a link
but with an `!` in front of it.

```md
![Image Name](image.jpg "alt text when you hover the image")
```

## Quoting

> this will quote some text

```md
> this will quote some text
```

## Code Example

For `inline` quoting, use single backticks:

```md
For `inline` quoting, use single backticks.
```

For block quotes, use tripple backticks:

```
this will write the content as if it is code
```

````md
```
this will write the content as if it is code
```
````

Add syntax highlighting by defining the language, for example:

```js
console.log("Hello, world!")
```

````md
```js
console.log("Hello, world!")
```
````
