- Commit the changes to the two files to a new branch named `vX.Y.X`
- Push the changes to the branch, and open a Pull Request, titled `vX.Y.X`
- Have someone else review the Pull Request, and merge when approved

## GitHub Release

- In the "Choose a tag" dropdown, type in the new version number, and select the _"Create new tag vX.Y.X"_ option
- Select "Generate release notes", this will auto-populate with all Pull Requests contained within the release.
- Manually group the list of PRs in the release notes into the following categories:
