## Beta Release

FlowFuse will release features in beta when it is known to be an early version that may lack features or functions that are intended to be made available at a later date. Pricing is generally a follow up function, and thus things might be released as Beta without pricing, where later the company might charge for the feature. The goal of releasing a feature in beta is that it provides for rapid learning of how users engage with the feature, as this informs later product development.

Beta features can only be introduced in tiers where we expect them to remain once they are successful. If no clear tier can be established for a beta feature, it must be introduced in the Enterprise tier, as moving features down to lower tiers is easier than moving them up. All beta features will be introduced in the licensed, non-open source version to allow the company the freedom to change things as needed.

Features initially released as beta versions may later be deprecated entirely, drastically reconfigured, priced differently, or in other ways very significantly revised compared to their initial beta version.
