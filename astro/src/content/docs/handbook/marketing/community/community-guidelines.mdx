## Node-RED is FlowFuse

We strongly encourage the belief that the Node-RED and FlowFuse communities are the same. Whether you are a FlowFuse community member or an employee, you should treat both community members equally. Remember, the success of FlowFuse lies in the success of Node-RED.

### General Guidelines

We recommend reading the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://nodered.org/about/conduct/) to help ensure that our community remains respectful, collaborative, and supportive. These principles are grounded in common sense and shared values. By adhering to them, we can create a welcoming environment for all members and foster a culture of mutual respect and growth.

## Community interactions.

As an employee of FlowFuse, when we interact with the OSS Node-RED community we must be mindful of our position. For example, when offering advice on the Node-RED forum or the Node-RED slack, the first answer we offer should be how a solution can be achieved using Node-RED. If a native Node-RED solution is not possible or the user would benefit from the advantages that FlowFuse offers, then, like any other person or company, we can offer FlowFuse as a potential solution.
