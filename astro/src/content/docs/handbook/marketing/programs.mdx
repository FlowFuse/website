title: Marketing Programs
---

Our marketing efforts are organized into several core programs. These are not
rigid silos but interconnected strategic areas designed to support the entire
customer journey, from initial awareness to long-term advocacy. Each program
consists of various ongoing activities and campaigns aimed at achieving specific
business goals.

## 1. Demand Generation

This area focuses on creating pipeline by attracting new prospects and capturing
qualified leads.

- **Paid Advertising Campaigns**: We run targeted digital ad campaigns (e.g.,
  ABM on LinkedIn, Google Ads) to reach specific audiences, drive traffic to our
  key content, and generate MQLs (Marketing Qualified Leads). See [Lead
  Activation](/handbook/marketing/lead-activation/) for definitions of inbound
  vs. outbound lead sources.
- **[Gated Resources](/handbook/marketing/leads/)**: We create and promote
  in-depth content such as whitepapers, ebooks, and guides. This content is
  gated, serving as a key tool for capturing new marketing qualified leads.
- **[Monthly Webinars](/handbook/marketing/webinars/)**: We host regular
  webinars to educate our audience, showcase our product, and generate new
  leads. They also serve as a valuable touchpoint for existing prospects and
  customers.
- **[Trade Shows & Industry Events](/handbook/marketing/events/)**: We
  participate in key industry events to build brand presence, network with
  potential customers and partners, and generate leads.

## 2. Content & Community Marketing

This area focuses on building our brand's authority and fostering a loyal
community through valuable content and engagement.

- **[Content Marketing (Blog)](/handbook/marketing/blog/)**: Our blog is the
  engine of our content strategy, focused on providing educational and
  insightful articles to drive organic traffic, establish thought leadership,
  and support our other marketing initiatives.
- **[Monthly Newsletters](/handbook/marketing/email/#community-email)**: We
  engage our community and customer base with regular email updates, sharing
  product news, valuable content, and upcoming events.
- **[Social Media](/handbook/marketing/social-media/)**: We maintain an active
  presence on key social platforms to engage with our community, amplify our
  content, and build our [brand's voice](/handbook/marketing/brand-voice/).
- **Podcast "Industrial Visionaries"**: Our podcast features conversations with
  industry leaders to explore key trends, provide unique insights, and expand
  our brand's reach to new audiences.
- **[Community Engagement & Sponsorships](/handbook/marketing/community/)**:
  We actively support and participate in the broader community, including
  sponsoring key events like the Node-RED conference, to strengthen our
  connection with developers and users.

## 3. Brand & Product Marketing

This area focuses on shaping our brand perception and effectively communicating
the value of our product.

- **[Website](/handbook/marketing/website/)**: While the website is a
  foundational platform rather than a program, its continuous improvement,
  content management, and optimization are a core marketing responsibility. It
  is the central hub for our brand and all our digital activities.
- **Product Evaluation (Trials & PoCs)**: We offer two primary paths for
  customers to evaluate FlowFuse, representing our joint Product-Led and
  Sales-Led growth motions.
  - **Self-Service Free Trial**: The cornerstone of our Product-Led Growth (PLG)
    strategy is the FlowFuse Cloud free trial. This program is driven by
    Marketing to acquire new users and optimized by the Product team to deliver
    an excellent in-app experience.
  - **Sales-Led Proof of Concept (PoC)**: For larger or more complex
    deployments, prospective customers may engage in a structured Proof of
    Concept. This is a [sales-led process](/handbook/sales/meetings/poc/)
    designed to validate specific use cases. Marketing supports this motion by
    providing relevant content and materials like customer stories and technical
    documentation.
- **[Customer Stories](/handbook/marketing/customer-stories/)**: This program
  focuses on creating compelling case studies and stories that provide social
  proof, showcase real-world use cases, and demonstrate the value of FlowFuse to
  prospects.

## 4. Customer Marketing & Advocacy

This area focuses on empowering our existing customers to become advocates for
our brand.

- **Voice of the Customer (Satisfaction Surveys)**: We systematically collect
  feedback through in-product surveys, post-webinar forms, and documentation
  sections. This continuous feedback loop is crucial for improving our product
  and overall customer experience.
- **Customer Reviews Program**: We actively encourage satisfied customers to
  share their experiences on platforms like
  [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/flowfuse/reviews). This program helps build
  trust and social proof for new potential customers.

## 5. Strategic Partnerships

We engage in strategic partnerships to expand our reach, validate our solutions, and create co-marketing opportunities that align with [FlowFuse’s strategy](/handbook/company/strategy/).  

Strategic partnerships can take different forms:
 - **Technology and solution partners** led by sales through the [Partners Program](/handbook/sales/partnerships/). This program focuses on building and nurturing relationships with technology partners and solution providers to expand our reach, enter new markets, and create co-marketing opportunities.
 - **Customers**, where joint marketing initiatives are occasionally included as part of a sales negotiation. These initiatives are aimed at demonstrating that FlowFuse provides a suited solution for our [ICP](/handbook/marketing/messaging/#ideal-customer-profile-(icp)).
 - **Influencers or vendors** with whom we may collaborate for sponsored content to reach audiences that value their expertise on topics relevant to our ICP.

When evaluating co-marketing opportunities, we consider:
- Relevance: Alignment with FlowFuse’s editorial calendar, strategic themes, and target audience.
- Value exchange: Clear deliverables such as published articles, videos, webinars, or social media posts, with measurable outcomes (reach, engagement, leads).
- Ownership: The Product Marketing Manager leads assessment and planning of co-marketing initiatives, in collaboration with the Marketing team and Sales as needed.
- Execution: DevRel validates externally created content to ensure quality, accuracy and consistency of deliverables.
- Measurement: Success is measured through defined KPIs such as reach, engagement, and lead generation.

All inbound proposals for co-marketing or sponsored content must be shared with the Product Marketing Manager for assessment before any commitments are made.

## 6. New Marketing Campaigns Process

proposals are evaluated consistently and that approved campaigns align with our
