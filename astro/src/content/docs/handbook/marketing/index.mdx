## What we do

We're the team that promotes our company and product of FlowFuse to the core audience
of FlowFuse. This includes:
1. Generating brand awareness.
1. Publishing high-quality content such as blog posts, video, and infographics.
1. Engaging with the Node-RED and nascent FlowFuse communities
1. Event planning, such as [trade shows](/handbook/marketing/events/)
1. Growth hacking; always be innovating when finding the audience and engaging with
them in a cost effective way.

The ultimate goal for the department is to [generate sales pipeline](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/reports-list/26586079/198880430/)
for the sales team.
The monthly budget of the department including headcount and program budget should be equal to 50-60% of monthly pipeline generated. 

### Marketing KPI

Our North Star metric is pipeline generated, the metric is supported by key input metrics that we track and measure:

- [FFC trial signups](https://product-metrics.flowfuse.cloud/dashboard/product)
- [Contact Sales form completions](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/submissions/26586079/form/734455e5-4cda-4329-97da-07e40cda791c/performance/)
- [Unique website visitors](https://eu.posthog.com/project/2209/insights/PXeb0YSF)

Each of these metrics is reported on weekly during our Marketing Team Meeting to ensure we're tracking progress toward our North Star.
