## Approval Process

Interested educators should complete [the request form](/education).

The paradigm of a legitimate application is an instructor or department head at an accredited university using FlowFuse to teach IIoT or similar. If the contact completed the form at [flowfuse.com/education](/education/), they should have already provided this information.
