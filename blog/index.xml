        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;FlowForge wants to enable everyone to build workflows in Node-RED. Since announcing
&lt;a href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/02/announcing-flowforge-cloud/&quot;&gt;FlowForge Cloud&lt;/a&gt;
two months ago we&#39;ve had a waiting list for users to sign up to. That allowed us
to control the pace we were bringing new users onto the platform, learning what
is needed to scale up our platform and continue to improve our first user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we have removed the waiting list. Anyone can sign up to FlowForge and start a
new Node-RED project in under a minute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;max-w-md m-auto&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a class=&quot;ff-btn ff-btn--primary&quot; href=&quot;https://app.flowforge.com/account/create&quot;&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-we-offer&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/05/sign-up-for-flowforge-cloud/#what-we-offer&quot;&gt;#&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; What we offer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the sub minute time to start a new Node-RED project, there&#39;s many more
features our offering includes. Two we&#39;d like to highlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start our blog highlight reel: Collaboration. FlowForge allows you to work
with a team on your flows. There&#39;s the ability to create multiple users, each
with their own credentials that can alter the flows on Node-RED, and it&#39;s
execution environment like for example the &lt;a href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/docs/user/envvar/&quot;&gt;environments variables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, &lt;a href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/docs/user/changestack&quot;&gt;stacks&lt;/a&gt;. These allow
a user to select the execution environment for their Node-RED project. For example; the
Node-RED version being used. Combined with the ability for one to copy a project
to a new stack, this allows FlowForge users to copy their project to the Node-RED
3.0-beta stack to validate their solutions will continue to work on the new release
without disrupting their main project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-roadmap&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/05/sign-up-for-flowforge-cloud/#our-roadmap&quot;&gt;#&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; Our roadmap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently we&#39;re working towards our 0.6 release. The main feature of this release
will be support for Devices. This will allow you to send a snapshot of a project
to a Node-RED instance running outside of the FlowForge platform and update the flows
remotely. Remote devices will run our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge-device-agent&quot;&gt;agent&lt;/a&gt;
to communicate with the FlowForge Cloud project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the first iteration will be considered an Alpha release, by shipping early and often, it lets us get
welcome feedback from our users and the wider community - helping to shape the future direction.
It also allows users to start validating the feature for their own proof of concept projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few months we&#39;re continuing to drive development of the platform
across a number of areas - including further improvements to the Device feature.
But also looking at new Enterprise-ready features, such as Single-Sign On integration
and more tools to make collaboration even easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We intend to grow our offering so that FlowForge remains the best way to run
Node-RED.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary>Bringing a new look to the platform</summary>
        <updated>2022-05-12T12:00:00Z</updated>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The cycle continues with our next regularly scheduled release, bringing a fresh
new look to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since joining the team, Joe has been hard at work bringing a more consistent
design language to what we&#39;re doing. This release brings a lot of his hardwork
to the platform itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s more to be done on the individual pages of the platform, but this
gives us a solid framework to build on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/05/images/ff-05-dashboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/430&quot;&gt;Epic #430 - Rebrand Forage App&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;copying-projects&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/05/flowforge-05-released/#copying-projects&quot;&gt;#&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; Copying Projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the usage scenarios we want to support is having an easy way to have separate
test and production environments. The previous release added the ability to configure
environment variables on individual projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release unlocks the next piece of the puzzle - making it easy to copy flows
between projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Project settings page has two new options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy Project lets you create a complete copy of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export to existing project lets you copy over selected aspects of the project
over to another project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, you get to pick what parts of the project should be copied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/268&quot;&gt;Epic #268 - Export Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/271&quot;&gt;Story #271 - Duplicate Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/272&quot;&gt;Story #272 - Export to Existing Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;improve-billing-information&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/05/flowforge-05-released/#improve-billing-information&quot;&gt;#&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; Improve Billing Information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve been getting some great feedback from the users of FlowForge Cloud. One of the
areas we identified as needing some more clarity was around the point users are
asked to setup their billing information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/563&quot;&gt;Story #563 - Improve Information on billing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;edge-devices&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/05/flowforge-05-released/#edge-devices&quot;&gt;#&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; Edge Devices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst we always want to deliver new functionality to end users in each release,
sometimes bits of work don&#39;t fit naturally into a single four week iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s the case here with some of the preliminary work we&#39;ve done to introduce
the idea of Edge Devices to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal here is to provide a way to easily deploy and manage Node-RED projects
on remote devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release introduces a bunch of work to the core app and front-end to begin
introducing the concept of a Device. It includes the basic workflows for registering
a device on the platform and being able to assign it to a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole feature is hidden behind a feature flag so users on FlowForge Cloud won&#39;t
see any of this quite yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next release will introduce the Edge Agent piece of this - the bit that runs
on devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/446&quot;&gt;Epic #446 - Devices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the FlowForge newsletter, a regular roundup of what`s happening with both FlowForge and the wider Node-RED community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve got something that you&#39;d like us to share please email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:contact@flowforge.com&quot;&gt;contact@flowforge.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/04/flowforge-04-released/&quot;&gt;FlowForge 0.4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The next release has enabled us to offer multiple versions of Node-RED along with adding more features to help you configure your Node-RED projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.nodered.org/t/node-red-3-0-0-beta-1-released/62124&quot;&gt;Node-RED 3.0.0-beta-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The first beta for Node-RED 3.0.0 has been published, there&#39;s some exciting improvements on UI in the editor to make designing your flows even easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/05/node-red-3-beta-stack/&quot;&gt;Node-RED Beta on FlowForge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As promised in out 0.4 announcement, we&#39;ve made the beta available to our users on FlowForge as a separate stack, this is just one way that we&#39;re able to demonstrate the flexibility you get from running Node-RED on FlowForge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/build/exploring-meraki-and-spark-apis-with-node-red/&quot;&gt;Cisco &amp;amp; Node-RED&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The team at Cisco DevNet published some great guides on using Node-RED to manage both your Meraki Access points and to integrate with WebEx Teams, they&#39;ve also produced a handy &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.cisco.com/developer/helloworldlowcodenodered01&quot;&gt;starter guide&lt;/a&gt; for those that are new to Node-RED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nrcon.nodered.org/&quot;&gt;Node-RED Con 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our friends in the Node-RED Japan User Group have run a number of successful Node-RED conferences over the last few years. This year, we&#39;re joining forces with them to bring the event to a wider audience. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.papercall.io/nrcon2022&quot;&gt;Call for Papers&lt;/a&gt; is open now and we&#39;d love to see your submissions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Node-RED 3.0 Beta Stack</title>
        <summary>Try out the next major Node-RED release</summary>

        <author><name>Sam Machin</name></author>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first beta of Node-RED 3.0 is here and FlowForge is ready for you to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we released &lt;a href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/04/flowforge-04-released/&quot;&gt;FlowForge 0.4&lt;/a&gt; last month we talked about allowing users to select the stack their project runs on.
Until now we&#39;ve only offered one stack which has been the latest Node-RED release (2.2.2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the first beta of Node-RED 3.0 was &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.nodered.org/t/node-red-3-0-0-beta-1-released/62124&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt;, so as of today we have added a choice of stacks to FlowForge Cloud. You can stick with the &lt;em&gt;Default&lt;/em&gt; and use Node-RED 2.2.2 or if you want to try out the beta you can select &lt;em&gt;Node-RED-3.0.0-beta-1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/05/images/beta_stack.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Selecting the beta Stack&quot; title=&quot;Selecting the beta Stack&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FlowForge is the best way to run multiple Node-RED instances at different versions. Beta releases are exciting to try out, but you don&#39;t want to risk your production applications with an early upgrade. FlowForge makes it easy to create a new project to try things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll continue to update the stack choice with each beta when they are released.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This release of the FlowForge adds a seemingly small, but significant new feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodered.org/about/releases/&quot;&gt;Node-RED 3.0 fast approaching&lt;/a&gt; we&#39;ve been making sure we are ready to support this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;upgrading-node-red&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/04/flowforge-04-released/#upgrading-node-red&quot;&gt;#&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; Upgrading Node-RED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of FlowForge is to be the best way to run Node-RED at any scale, whether that&#39;s many users or many instances. Node-RED is a constantly developing as a platform and therefore part of running Node-RED is also upgrading the version you are running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the 0.4 release today we&#39;ve made that super simple in FlowForge. Last month we introduced the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/docs/user/concepts/#project-stack&quot;&gt;Project Stacks&lt;/a&gt;. One of the key elements of a Stack was the version of Node-RED in use. Initially this may have seemed fairly basic, when you create a new project you usually want to use the latest version of Node-RED. However what happens when a new version is released and you have an existing project?
Now you can change the stack that a project is running on, which in turn will change the version of Node-RED. This is a simple process from the project settings, it only requires a short period of downtime while the project restarts on the new stack, typically around 10-15 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our driver to get this feature into the 0.4 release is the approaching release of Node-RED 3.0, now we know that we can be ready to offer our users Node-RED 3.0 as soon as it is released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also be making available the Beta&#39;s of Node-RED 3.0 within FlowForge Cloud,  this becomes a great way to test out the new features without having to touch your own environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/288&quot;&gt;Story #288 - Change Stacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/docs/user/changestack/&quot;&gt;Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;environment-variables&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/04/flowforge-04-released/#environment-variables&quot;&gt;#&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; Environment Variables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key new feature we are introducing is the ability to set and manage environment variables within your projects.
Environment Variables are a key tool when building applications as they allow you to to separate the configuration of your system from the logic in the code. Even in Low-Code platforms this is an important design pattern. Environment variables are fully integrated into &lt;a href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/docs/user/concepts/#project-template&quot;&gt;Templates&lt;/a&gt; that we introduced last month so they can be set both at the platform level or on an individual project.
Our plans for the next release will make these even more useful as we introduce the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/271&quot;&gt;duplicate a project&lt;/a&gt; and then modify those variables for the new project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/225&quot;&gt;Story #225 - Project Environment Variables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/docs/user/envvar/&quot;&gt;Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more improvements in this release, such as the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/239&quot;&gt;Set the timezone&lt;/a&gt; your project is running in, we&#39;ve also been iterating on our billing experience as we&#39;ve welcomed the first paying customers to FlowForge Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we&#39;re very happy that we&#39;ve had our first external contribution to the code base, as an Open Core company we believe strongly that Open Source lives at the heart of everything we do.
We would like to say a big thank-you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fakocodes.netlify.app/&quot;&gt;Fakorede Damilola Idris&lt;/a&gt; for his work on fixing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/424&quot;&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; in the UI.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the FlowForge newsletter, a regular roundup of what`s happening with both FlowForge and the wider Node-RED community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve got something that you&#39;d like us to share please email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:contact@flowforge.com&quot;&gt;contact@flowforge.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/&quot;&gt;New Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some of you may have noticed the new design on our website, this is the first step in our more refined corporate identity, the same look will be coming to the FlowForge application &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/430&quot;&gt;soon.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/03/flowforge-03-released/&quot;&gt;FlowForge 0.3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The latest release introduced 2 new concepts, Templates and Stacks, with these we are starting to show the value of the FlowForge platform allowing you to easily manage the Node-RED settings and versions used by your projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opto22.com/support/resources-tools/videos/video-introduction-to-json-for-node-red/&quot;&gt;Intro to JSON for Node-RED&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our friends over at Opto 22 published a handy guide to JSON and how it works in Node-RED, great introduction for new builders and a good refresher for seasoned pros.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>FlowForge is accepting customers now</title>
        <summary>We&#39;re starting to onboard users from the waitlist</summary>
        <updated>2022-04-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
        <link href="https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/04/flowforge-accepting-customers/"/>
        <author><name>Zeger-Jan van de Weg</name></author>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A year ago our CTO, Nick O&#39;Leary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2021/04/first-deploy/&quot;&gt;introduced FlowForge&lt;/a&gt;.
Since then major milestones have been achieved. As we grow as a company, important
steps are taken. Today we make another very important step; we&#39;re accepting our
first customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago our product was nearly in a state where it could support customers,
when that was the case, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/02/announcing-flowforge-cloud/&quot;&gt;opened up our waitlist&lt;/a&gt;.
The waitlist has been growing daily and now we&#39;re ready to start inviting those
users onto the platform. The first
lucky few users are being added today, and each working day for the foreseeable
future we&#39;ll continue onboarding users. New users will receive an email from our
team with their login details and can start creating new workflows with Node-RED
minutes after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the source code of FlowForge is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt;,
there&#39;s a chance you&#39;re unfamiliar with what has been built around Node-RED.
With FlowForge, our intent is to build a platform to aid with colaboration of
flows in Node-RED. The first steps to our vision include a managed Node-RED
instance to connect virtually any online service. Multiple users will have
access to the same flows and can collaborate. Further, once Node-RED 3.0 has
been released, the platform will provide a pain-free way to upgrade and keep
your projects up to date. There&#39;s many more exciting features right around the
corner on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/flowforge/projects/5&quot;&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>FlowForge 0.3 released</title>
        <summary>Moving towards the launch of FlowForge Cloud</summary>
        <updated>2022-03-17T01:00:00Z</updated>
        <link href="https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/03/flowforge-03-released/"/>
        <author><name>Nick O&#39;Leary</name></author>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The FlowForge 0.3 release brings us closer to the launch of FlowForge Cloud.
Find out more about what&#39;s in this new release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release of the FlowForge platform brings some significant new features that
will underpin more of what is to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-stacks-%26-templates&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/03/flowforge-03-released/#project-stacks-%26-templates&quot;&gt;#&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; Project Stacks &amp;amp; Templates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we think about what a makes a Project inside FlowForge, the simple answer
is Node-RED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more complete answer is: a version of Node-RED, a version of Node.js, some
memory, some CPU and a bunch of Node-RED settings to customise the instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a platform like FlowForge, it&#39;s important to have the tools to manage all
of these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Project Stacks and Template come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Project Stack defines the underlying characteristics of the Node-RED process -
or the container it is running in. For example, with our Local deployment model,
it defines the version of Node-RED to use and how much memory the process should
try to use. In our container based deployment models, the stack identifies the
container to use for the project, along with memory and CPU limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a future release, this will be the way we will support upgrading the version
of Node-RED a project is using - and doing so in a well managed way. An Administrator
will be able to create a new Stack containing the new version of Node-RED.
Project owners will then be able to update their projects to use the new Stack -
at a time that is convenient to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Project Template is more about how the Node-RED instance is configured - exposing
the options a user would traditional modify in their Node-RED settings file.
With this release, we&#39;re not exposing a lot of settings as the focus has been
more on the underlying Template concept. But it will be the basis for gradually
exposing more options for customisation in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/285&quot;&gt;Epic #285 - Project Stacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/141&quot;&gt;Epic #141 - Project Templates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;billing-integration&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/03/flowforge-03-released/#billing-integration&quot;&gt;#&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; Billing Integration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our open core philosophy, the heart of the FlowForge platform is open source
and available under the Apache 2 license for anyone to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the plan was always to have certain features that were licensed separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release brings the first of those features - Stripe Billing Integration. This
feature brings the ability to require a Team to have a Stripe Billing agreement
in place and to be able to charge on a per-project basis within that Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to charge is an important feature for any commercial platform, and
with our own FlowForge Cloud launching soon, we needed to get this feature in
place today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve structured the code in the repository and updated the LICENSE file to make it
very clear what parts of the code base are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; covered by the Apache 2 license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/224&quot;&gt;Epic #224 - Billing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documentation provides a guide for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/tree/main/docs&quot;&gt;installing FlowForge on a local server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&#39;t played with FlowForge yet, here&#39;s a more complete walk-through
of the platform:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our regular release cycle puts the next release on Thursday 14th April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re still in planning stage for the release, but we&#39;ll also be beginning to invite

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As an open core company, anyone is free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/tree/9219e81399eaf52fb0ee5573707a52f5520fbfdd/docs/install&quot;&gt;download and install&lt;/a&gt;
our platform. In many cases this is a great solution, it
allows for custom setups in your own environment. We know this isn&#39;t for everyone
though, some people just want to start building with Node-RED without having to manage their servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce FlowForge Cloud, a hosted
Node-RED as a service offering and today we are opening the waitlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our waitlist captures your email, and we&#39;ll reach out to you on that address once your account is created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;starting-operations&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/02/announcing-flowforge-cloud/#starting-operations&quot;&gt;#&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; Starting operations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having released v0.2 recently, we&#39;re now working on v0.3 that will include
a user flow for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/224&quot;&gt;billing&lt;/a&gt;.
When that work has been done and deployed people on the waitlist will slowly be invited to the platform.
Currently that&#39;s scheduled for April 1st, no joke, although it could happen either sooner
or later.
More details on the exact pricing will be availble nearer the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are invited you will be able to;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create multiple Node-RED projects hosted on flowforge.cloud,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invite team members to collaborate on those projects,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And many more features will automatically become availble with each new release.&lt;/li&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Four weeks have passed since our initial release of FlowForge, and we&#39;re happy
to release v0.2 today as we continue moving forward and evolve the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There aren&#39;t lots of headline features in this release to tell you about as a lot
of the work has been on the internals, as well as responding to some of the early
feedback from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features like improving the test framework, and building a database migration
framework may not sound too exciting to the end user, but they are critical pieces
when build a platform that needs to be stable and easy to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve also been doing work to get our own instance of the platform running in the
Cloud - and figuring out how to automate as much of that as possible. Aside
from being a key way to test the platform, it helps validate the work we&#39;re doing
for when others come to run it in that way. It also lays the ground work for our
own cloud service we&#39;ll be sharing more about in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full change-log for the core of the platform is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/blob/v0.2.0/CHANGELOG.md&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.
But with a further 15 repositories containing different components, each with its
own change-log, we&#39;re still thinking about how best to share a single view of the
updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our regular release cycle puts the next release on Thursday 17th March. We&#39;ve
got some key features planned in this release around &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/141&quot;&gt;Project Templates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/285&quot;&gt;Stacks&lt;/a&gt; -
which will underpin how you can customise Node-RED within FlowForge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll also have some exciting news to share about our own hosted service you&#39;ll
be able to sign-up for.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/krishnanravichandran/&quot;&gt;Krisnan Ravichandran&lt;/a&gt; works
for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbp.solar/&quot;&gt;spb sonne&lt;/a&gt;, a engineering consultancy for renewable
energy. Within the company he is part of the engineering effort on the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbp.de/en/news/goembhal-sbp-sonnes-pioneering-floating-pv-system/&quot;&gt;Gömbhal&lt;/a&gt;
project, creating a floatation device for solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, he shares his experiences of using Node-RED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently there’s a prototype deployed in Hungary, while the company is located
in Stuttgart: “We’re remotely monitoring the installation. There are over 40
sensors that all connect to an ADAM-6717, Compact Intelligent Gateway. When the
data is acquired we leverage Node-RED flows that maintain the structure, monitor
performance, and provide reporting back to our offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node-RED is embedded in the ADAM 6717, it was very new to me. I was already
experienced in programming, mainly Python, and within a month I felt very
comfortable and productive in Node-RED. Understanding programming is useful,
though not a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building and improving flows I did on my own through trial-and-error, as well
as a lot of times through help on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.nodered.org/&quot;&gt;Node-RED Forum&lt;/a&gt;.
The community is helpful and welcoming to new users. Now I maintain multiple
flows with very different purposes. Some track temperature,
irradiation wind-speed, direction, tilt and wave height; to ensure the floating
PV installation remains floating. Other sensors are connected to actuators
through flows that control pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have some challenges; the ADAM 6717 contained an older version of Node-RED.
This raised questions around security and maintenance, as our Node-RED version
isn’t updated to a newer version in an easy manner. It also hampers training a
bit because documentation might reference an API or node for a flow that’s just
not the same on older versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I’d choose Node-RED again, it’s well known as well as easy to learn.
Furthermore I found it very versatile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Krisnan for sharing his story. If you have a Node-RED story for us
to share, please get in touch via &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:contact@flowforge.com&quot;&gt;contact@flowforge.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>FlowForge 0.1 released</title>
        <summary>Making the first release of the platform and transitioning to open development</summary>
        <updated>2022-01-20T01:00:00Z</updated>

        <author><name>Nick O&#39;Leary</name></author>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For an open core company, we haven&#39;t been very open with what we&#39;re doing. That all
changes today with the release of FlowForge 0.1 and making all of our repositories
public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a significant step for the company as we look to build a platform around Node-RED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main question we get asked is: &#39;What is FlowForge?&amp;quot; - which is a very reasonable
question to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FlowForge is a platform for managing Node-RED instances at scale. It lets you have
multiple users on the platform, organised into teams to provide proper access control
to individual Node-RED instances, or Projects as we call them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the 0.1 release, we have the basic building blocks of the platform in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add multiple users to the platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create teams for those users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create Node-RED projects quickly and easily through the platform UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a more complete walk-through of the platform in this early release, you can
watch this video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YYZDx8n17Ys&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documentation provides a guide for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/tree/main/docs&quot;&gt;installing FlowForge on a local server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have drivers for deploying to Docker Compose and Kubernetes based environments
to enable a larger scale of deployment. We&#39;ll have more documentation on those options
in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you hit any problems with the platform, or have questions to ask, please do
raise an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues&quot;&gt;issue on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That also includes if you have any feedback or feature requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so much in the plan and lots of exciting features to come, we will have a
regular cycle of releases every four weeks. So you can expect the next release, 0.2,
on Thursday 17th February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we&#39;re only at 0.1 today, there is a lot still to do. We will be following the
principles of &lt;a href=&quot;https://semver.org/&quot;&gt;Semantic Versioning&lt;/a&gt; with our releases,
but until we reach 1.0, there may be some disruptive changes along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve is a well known face in the Node-RED community. He is a regular contributor
to the community forum, always happy to help users with their questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has published a number of very popular nodes, include &lt;a href=&quot;https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-buffer-parser&quot;&gt;buffer-parser&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-cron-plus&quot;&gt;cron-plus&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-image-tools&quot;&gt;image-tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has also made some significant contributions to the core of Node-RED, such as
delivering MQTTv5 support and introducing the Monaco code editor into the heart
of the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve joins us from a background in Industrial IoT in the automative manufacturing
space - experience and knowledge that will be invaluable as we look to growing the
FlowForge platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve will be focussed on the Node-RED side of our activities - helping to continue
the ongoing development and growth of the open source project at the heart of what
FlowForge is about.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This year the FlowForge team will grow further, and I&#39;m excited to announce our
newest addition to the team; Zeger-Jan van de Weg (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ZJvandeWeg&quot;&gt;@ZJvandeWeg&lt;/a&gt;).
Zeger-Jan, also known as ZJ, is joining FlowForge as CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZJ previously worked at GitLab where he helped build a vibrant open source
community and we&#39;re thrilled to have him to continue this with the Node-RED
community. Under his supervision the involvement of GitLab in the Git project
grew significantly, allowing Git and GitLab to be successful together. This aligns
well with our vision for FlowForge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will only be successful if the whole Node-RED community is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our first non-engineering hire, ZJ will be focussed on growing the business side
of FlowForge, working on marketing and ongoing business development.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the things I&#39;m most looking forward to with starting FlowForge is building
the team who are going to help create something special and have fun whilst doing it.
With Ben having joined last week, this week I get to share the news that Sam Machin (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sammachin&quot;&gt;@sammachin&lt;/a&gt;) is joining the team as a Senior Developer Advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam is a seasoned Developer Advocate, who really understands the difference
between evangelism and advocacy. He is acutely aware of the differences between
developers as customers and as partners in an ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Node-RED community is so important to us - we simply wouldn&#39;t be doing what
we do today without their support. As we continue to drive the project forward,
and build the FlowForge platform around it, we have to keep developers are the heart
of what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping that 2-way conversation open is not an easy task, but Sam&#39;s in a great
position to help us do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam is an experienced Product Manager and will be able to give the community a seat at the table when it comes to shaping our plans. The Node-RED community is an integral part of what will make FlowForge a success and his first responsibility is to ensure that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve known Ben for many years, having worked together at IBM. He&#39;s been an active member
of the Node-RED community since the start of the project and he published one of
the very first &lt;a href=&quot;https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-node-geofence&quot;&gt;3rd party nodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is ever-present on Stack Overflow, to the point where I&#39;ve long since stopped
rushing to respond to questions tagged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node-red&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;node-red&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
in the full knowledge that he has usually beaten me to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently he&#39;s been doing some really interesting work exploring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2020/10/01/multi-tenant-node-red/&quot;&gt;multi-tenant Node-RED systems&lt;/a&gt; - something we&#39;ll

        <title>Introducing FlowForge Inc.</title>
        <summary>Building a new low-code development platform around the Node-RED project</summary>
        <updated>2021-04-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
        <link href="https://flowforge.com/blog/2021/04/first-deploy/"/>
        <author><name>Nick O&#39;Leary</name></author>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When Dave and I first created &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodered.org/&quot;&gt;Node-RED&lt;/a&gt;, it was a tool to solve a
problem - allowing us to do our day job more effectively when building IoT solutions
for clients. That gave us the means and purpose to create a truly useful platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it became an open source project, it quickly found an enthusiastic audience that
has seen the community grow beyond our imagination. From both individual users, to a wide
range of companies integrating it into their own products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with that growth, the question in my mind has always been how to take it further
and secure its long term future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodered.org/blog/2020/10/13/future-plans&quot;&gt;project blog&lt;/a&gt;
last year about the future plans of the project. A key piece of that is its sustainability -
how we can increase the commercial adoption of Node-RED and how we can get more people
contributing back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An opportunity presented itself earlier this year that I believe will bring a
step-change to what the Node-RED project is able to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;introducing-flowforge-inc.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2021/04/first-deploy/#introducing-flowforge-inc.&quot;&gt;#&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; Introducing FlowForge Inc.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today, I&#39;m launching FlowForge Inc - a new company whose mission is to build a low-coding development
platform fit for the enterprise with Node-RED at its heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/sijbrandij/&quot;&gt;Sid Sijbrandij&lt;/a&gt;, we have funding
in place to create a fully remote team dedicated to an open core model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short term, this means helping to accelerate the plans already in place for
the Open Source project. Getting the 2.0 release done in the next few weeks, working on
long-standing features such as the Test framework and Flow Debugger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside that we&#39;ll also be building a platform around Node-RED that will make it easier
to adopt at scale and integrate into existing enterprise environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node-RED remains a fully open source project, with its home at the OpenJS Foundation
and an open governance model that allows anyone to have a say in its development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to incorporate as much of our work directly into the core project as possible. Where we do create closed-source components, we will work with the community to ensure the right APIs and extension points are in the core for all to benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will only be successful if the whole Node-RED community is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me personally, this is a really exciting next step. I never expected to turn my little side project into a full-time job and now into a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hiring-soon!&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2021/04/first-deploy/#hiring-soon!&quot;&gt;#&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; Hiring soon!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll be hiring soon - so keep an eye out if you&#39;re interesting in getting involved.&lt;/p&gt;
