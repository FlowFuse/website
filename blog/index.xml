        <title>FlowForge 0.3 released</title>
        <summary>Moving towards the launch of FlowForge Cloud</summary>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The FlowForge 0.3 release brings us closer to the launch of FlowForge Cloud.
Find out more about what&#39;s in this new release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release of the FlowForge platform brings some significant new features that
will underpin more of what is to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-stacks-%26-templates&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/03/flowforge-03-released/#project-stacks-%26-templates&quot;&gt;#&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; Project Stacks &amp;amp; Templates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we think about what a makes a Project inside FlowForge, the simple answer
is Node-RED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more complete answer is: a version of Node-RED, a version of Node.js, some
memory, some CPU and a bunch of Node-RED settings to customise the instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a platform like FlowForge, it&#39;s important to have the tools to manage all
of these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Project Stacks and Template come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Project Stack defines the underlying characteristics of the Node-RED process -
or the container it is running in. For example, with our Local deployment model,
it defines the version of Node-RED to use and how much memory the process should
try to use. In our container based deployment models, the stack identifies the
container to use for the project, along with memory and CPU limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a future release, this will be the way we will support upgrading the version
of Node-RED a project is using - and doing so in a well managed way. An Administrator
will be able to create a new Stack containing the new version of Node-RED.
Project owners will then be able to update their projects to use the new Stack -
at a time that is convenient to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Project Template is more about how the Node-RED instance is configured - exposing
the options a user would traditional modify in their Node-RED settings file.
With this release, we&#39;re not exposing a lot of settings as the focus has been
more on the underlying Template concept. But it will be the basis for gradually
exposing more options for customisation in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/285&quot;&gt;Epic #285 - Project Stacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/141&quot;&gt;Epic #141 - Project Templates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;billing-integration&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/03/flowforge-03-released/#billing-integration&quot;&gt;#&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; Billing Integration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our open core philosophy, the heart of the FlowForge platform is open source
and available under the Apache 2 license for anyone to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the plan was always to have certain features that were licensed separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release brings the first of those features - Stripe Billing Integration. This
feature brings the ability to require a Team to have a Stripe Billing agreement
in place and to be able to charge on a per-project basis within that Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to charge is an important feature for any commercial platform, and
with our own FlowForge Cloud launching soon, we needed to get this feature in
place today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve structured the code in the repository and updated the LICENSE file to make it
very clear what parts of the code base are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; covered by the Apache 2 license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/224&quot;&gt;Epic #224 - Billing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

our platform. In many cases this is a great solution, it
allows for custom setups in your own environment. We know this isn&#39;t for everyone

&lt;p&gt;After having released v0.2 recently, we&#39;re now working on v0.3 that will include
a user flow for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/224&quot;&gt;billing&lt;/a&gt;.
When that work has been done and deployed people on the waitlist will slowly be invited to the platform.
Currently that&#39;s scheduled for April 1st, no joke, although it could happen either sooner
or later.
More details on the exact pricing will be availble nearer the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are invited you will be able to;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create multiple Node-RED projects hosted on flowforge.cloud,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invite team members to collaborate on those projects,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And many more features will automatically become availble with each new release.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>FlowForge 0.2 released</title>
        <summary>Keeping the releases flowing of our open platform for Node-RED</summary>
        <updated>2022-02-17T01:00:00Z</updated>
        <link href="https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/02/flowforge-02-released/"/>
        <author><name>Nick O&#39;Leary</name></author>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Four weeks have passed since our initial release of FlowForge, and we&#39;re happy
to release v0.2 today as we continue moving forward and evolve the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There aren&#39;t lots of headline features in this release to tell you about as a lot
of the work has been on the internals, as well as responding to some of the early
feedback from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features like improving the test framework, and building a database migration
framework may not sound too exciting to the end user, but they are critical pieces
when build a platform that needs to be stable and easy to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve also been doing work to get our own instance of the platform running in the
Cloud - and figuring out how to automate as much of that as possible. Aside
from being a key way to test the platform, it helps validate the work we&#39;re doing
for when others come to run it in that way. It also lays the ground work for our
own cloud service we&#39;ll be sharing more about in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full change-log for the core of the platform is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/blob/v0.2.0/CHANGELOG.md&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.
But with a further 15 repositories containing different components, each with its
own change-log, we&#39;re still thinking about how best to share a single view of the
updates.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using Node-RED to keep Solar PV afloat</title>
        <summary>How spb sonne used Node-RED with a renewable energy solution</summary>
        <updated>2022-02-09T09:26:00Z</updated>
        <link href="https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/02/use-case-solar-afloat/"/>
        <author><name>Zeger-Jan van de Weg</name></author>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/krishnanravichandran/&quot;&gt;Krisnan Ravichandran&lt;/a&gt; works
for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbp.solar/&quot;&gt;spb sonne&lt;/a&gt;, a engineering consultancy for renewable
energy. Within the company he is part of the engineering effort on the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbp.de/en/news/goembhal-sbp-sonnes-pioneering-floating-pv-system/&quot;&gt;Gömbhal&lt;/a&gt;
project, creating a floatation device for solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, he shares his experiences of using Node-RED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently there’s a prototype deployed in Hungary, while the company is located
in Stuttgart: “We’re remotely monitoring the installation. There are over 40
sensors that all connect to an ADAM-6717, Compact Intelligent Gateway. When the
data is acquired we leverage Node-RED flows that maintain the structure, monitor
performance, and provide reporting back to our offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node-RED is embedded in the ADAM 6717, it was very new to me. I was already
experienced in programming, mainly Python, and within a month I felt very
comfortable and productive in Node-RED. Understanding programming is useful,
though not a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building and improving flows I did on my own through trial-and-error, as well
as a lot of times through help on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.nodered.org/&quot;&gt;Node-RED Forum&lt;/a&gt;.
The community is helpful and welcoming to new users. Now I maintain multiple
flows with very different purposes. Some track temperature,
irradiation wind-speed, direction, tilt and wave height; to ensure the floating
PV installation remains floating. Other sensors are connected to actuators
through flows that control pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have some challenges; the ADAM 6717 contained an older version of Node-RED.
This raised questions around security and maintenance, as our Node-RED version
isn’t updated to a newer version in an easy manner. It also hampers training a
bit because documentation might reference an API or node for a flow that’s just
not the same on older versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I’d choose Node-RED again, it’s well known as well as easy to learn.
Furthermore I found it very versatile.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>FlowForge 0.1 released</title>
        <summary>Making the first release of the platform and transitioning to open development</summary>
        <updated>2022-01-20T01:00:00Z</updated>

        <author><name>Nick O&#39;Leary</name></author>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For an open core company, we haven&#39;t been very open with what we&#39;re doing. That all
changes today with the release of FlowForge 0.1 and making all of our repositories
public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a significant step for the company as we look to build a platform around Node-RED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main question we get asked is: &#39;What is FlowForge?&amp;quot; - which is a very reasonable
question to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FlowForge is a platform for managing Node-RED instances at scale. It lets you have
multiple users on the platform, organised into teams to provide proper access control
to individual Node-RED instances, or Projects as we call them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the 0.1 release, we have the basic building blocks of the platform in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add multiple users to the platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create teams for those users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create Node-RED projects quickly and easily through the platform UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a more complete walk-through of the platform in this early release, you can
watch this video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YYZDx8n17Ys&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documentation provides a guide for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/tree/main/docs&quot;&gt;installing FlowForge on a local server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have drivers for deploying to Docker Compose and Kubernetes based environments
to enable a larger scale of deployment. We&#39;ll have more documentation on those options
in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you hit any problems with the platform, or have questions to ask, please do
raise an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues&quot;&gt;issue on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That also includes if you have any feedback or feature requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what&#39;s-next%3F&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/01/flowforge-01-released/#what&#39;s-next%3F&quot;&gt;#&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; What&#39;s next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so much in the plan and lots of exciting features to come, we will have a
regular cycle of releases every four weeks. So you can expect the next release, 0.2,
on Thursday 17th February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we&#39;re only at 0.1 today, there is a lot still to do. We will be following the
principles of &lt;a href=&quot;https://semver.org/&quot;&gt;Semantic Versioning&lt;/a&gt; with our releases,
but until we reach 1.0, there may be some disruptive changes along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign up to the mailing list below if you want to hear more about the work we&#39;re
doing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re continuing to grow the FlowForge team with our latest hire; Steve McLaughlin
who is joining our development team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve is a well known face in the Node-RED community. He is a regular contributor
to the community forum, always happy to help users with their questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has published a number of very popular nodes, include &lt;a href=&quot;https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-buffer-parser&quot;&gt;buffer-parser&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-cron-plus&quot;&gt;cron-plus&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-image-tools&quot;&gt;image-tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has also made some significant contributions to the core of Node-RED, such as
delivering MQTTv5 support and introducing the Monaco code editor into the heart
of the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve joins us from a background in Industrial IoT in the automative manufacturing
space - experience and knowledge that will be invaluable as we look to growing the
FlowForge platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve will be focussed on the Node-RED side of our activities - helping to continue
the ongoing development and growth of the open source project at the heart of what
FlowForge is about.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This year the FlowForge team will grow further, and I&#39;m excited to announce our
newest addition to the team; Zeger-Jan van de Weg (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ZJvandeWeg&quot;&gt;@ZJvandeWeg&lt;/a&gt;).
Zeger-Jan, also known as ZJ, is joining FlowForge as CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZJ previously worked at GitLab where he helped build a vibrant open source
community and we&#39;re thrilled to have him to continue this with the Node-RED
community. Under his supervision the involvement of GitLab in the Git project
grew significantly, allowing Git and GitLab to be successful together. This aligns
well with our vision for FlowForge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will only be successful if the whole Node-RED community is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our first non-engineering hire, ZJ will be focussed on growing the business side
of FlowForge, working on marketing and ongoing business development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome aboard ZJ!&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the things I&#39;m most looking forward to with starting FlowForge is building
the team who are going to help create something special and have fun whilst doing it.
With Ben having joined last week, this week I get to share the news that Sam Machin (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sammachin&quot;&gt;@sammachin&lt;/a&gt;) is joining the team as a Senior Developer Advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam is a seasoned Developer Advocate, who really understands the difference
between evangelism and advocacy. He is acutely aware of the differences between
developers as customers and as partners in an ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Node-RED community is so important to us - we simply wouldn&#39;t be doing what
we do today without their support. As we continue to drive the project forward,
and build the FlowForge platform around it, we have to keep developers are the heart
of what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping that 2-way conversation open is not an easy task, but Sam&#39;s in a great
position to help us do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam is an experienced Product Manager and will be able to give the community a seat at the table when it comes to shaping our plans. The Node-RED community is an integral part of what will make FlowForge a success and his first responsibility is to ensure that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome aboard Sam!&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m excited to share the news that Ben Hardill (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hardillb&quot;&gt;@hardillb&lt;/a&gt;) is joining FlowForge as a Senior Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve known Ben for many years, having worked together at IBM. He&#39;s been an active member
of the Node-RED community since the start of the project and he published one of
the very first &lt;a href=&quot;https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-node-geofence&quot;&gt;3rd party nodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is ever-present on Stack Overflow, to the point where I&#39;ve long since stopped
rushing to respond to questions tagged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node-red&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;node-red&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
in the full knowledge that he has usually beaten me to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently he&#39;s been doing some really interesting work exploring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2020/10/01/multi-tenant-node-red/&quot;&gt;multi-tenant Node-RED systems&lt;/a&gt; - something we&#39;ll
be continuing at FlowForge.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing FlowForge Inc.</title>
        <summary>Building a new low-code development platform around the Node-RED project</summary>
        <updated>2021-04-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
        <link href="https://flowforge.com/blog/2021/04/first-deploy/"/>
        <author><name>Nick O&#39;Leary</name></author>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When Dave and I first created &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodered.org/&quot;&gt;Node-RED&lt;/a&gt;, it was a tool to solve a
problem - allowing us to do our day job more effectively when building IoT solutions
for clients. That gave us the means and purpose to create a truly useful platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it became an open source project, it quickly found an enthusiastic audience that
has seen the community grow beyond our imagination. From both individual users, to a wide
range of companies integrating it into their own products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with that growth, the question in my mind has always been how to take it further
and secure its long term future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodered.org/blog/2020/10/13/future-plans&quot;&gt;project blog&lt;/a&gt;
last year about the future plans of the project. A key piece of that is its sustainability -
how we can increase the commercial adoption of Node-RED and how we can get more people
contributing back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An opportunity presented itself earlier this year that I believe will bring a
step-change to what the Node-RED project is able to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;introducing-flowforge-inc.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2021/04/first-deploy/#introducing-flowforge-inc.&quot;&gt;#&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; Introducing FlowForge Inc.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today, I&#39;m launching FlowForge Inc - a new company whose mission is to build a low-coding development
platform fit for the enterprise with Node-RED at its heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/sijbrandij/&quot;&gt;Sid Sijbrandij&lt;/a&gt;, we have funding
in place to create a fully remote team dedicated to an open core model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short term, this means helping to accelerate the plans already in place for
the Open Source project. Getting the 2.0 release done in the next few weeks, working on
long-standing features such as the Test framework and Flow Debugger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside that we&#39;ll also be building a platform around Node-RED that will make it easier
to adopt at scale and integrate into existing enterprise environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node-RED remains a fully open source project, with its home at the OpenJS Foundation
and an open governance model that allows anyone to have a say in its development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to incorporate as much of our work directly into the core project as possible. Where we do create closed-source components, we will work with the community to ensure the right APIs and extension points are in the core for all to benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will only be successful if the whole Node-RED community is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me personally, this is a really exciting next step. I never expected to turn my little side project into a full-time job and now into a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hiring-soon!&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://flowforge.com/blog/2021/04/first-deploy/#hiring-soon!&quot;&gt;#&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; Hiring soon!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll be hiring soon - so keep an eye out if you&#39;re interesting in getting involved.&lt;/p&gt;
