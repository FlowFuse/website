## Vacation Policy

FlowForge has a unlimited time off policy. Taking vacation is encouraged for all
team members. To prevent an undefined number of vacation days to start a race to
the bottom, we recommend each team member to take a minimum of 25 days a year,
and at least 5 days a quarter.

### Logging time off

When taking more than 3 days off consecutively, tell (don't ask) your manager. 
This ensure scheduling of work and operations continue to run smoothly without
you. When taking over 2 weeks of consecutively seek approval from your manager.

Before you can take time off you should _always_:
* Log your time off in BambooHR
* Add an 'Out of office' appointment in your personal Google Calendar, and decline
   all meetings automatically.
