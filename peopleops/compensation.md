# Compensation

Total compensation consists of 3 elements, salary, equity, and benefits.
FlowForge aims to provide a total compensation package on par with similar
companies in terms of: stage of the company, market, role, and level in the role.
The data to validate our compensation is obtained through OptionImpact/Pave.com.

## Salary

Salary for each role is determined initially during the hiring process based
on compensation expectation of the candidate as well as the market rates. Salary
is based on your location you live in and the company context. FlowForge pays in
your local currency unless explicitly discussed otherwise.

### Adjustments

Salary can be increased twice a year. In September, a performance adjustment is
done. Performance review is based on [our values](../company#values), and
meeting role expectations. A review is held by the CEO and CTO for each employee.
They will write 2 to 3 paragraphs of text on what has gone well this year and where
the employee can still grow. This text is shared with each individual employee.
Compensation increase is expected to be between 0 and 5 percent for October
onwards.

Each January compensation is adjusted for each employee with the company for
over 6 months. Inflation is set to the value for the preceding calendar year as
reported by a international authority (IMF) or else by a recognised national
statistics authority.

## Equity

FlowForge offers equity for all roles depending on the same variables that decide
salary, except your location. Equity is offered as stock options, which upon
execution will be transformed in the underlying stock. Stock compensation are
awarded on a 4 year vesting schedule with a 1 year cliff. Equity compensation
will not vary based on employee location. Equity is only increased on employee
promotions. Carta wrote a great blog post about [vesting schedules and a cliff](https://carta.com/blog/what-is-stock-vesting).

Employees might be taxed personally when accepting or executing stock options.
FlowForge does not provide any advice on financial decisions for employees. For
FlowForge employees the Fair Market Value of the underlying stock can be found
in [this internal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_DmqzQ5rmjYHlBvF5owJpj3JVR_BlJUg_S-pwfRtA5g).

## Benefits

Last component of the total compensation are the benefits offered. The intent is
to keep these as location independent as possible and practical. However, as a
company we strive to offer everyone a decent standard of living. As such we might
offer location dependant benefits to ensure standards are met.
