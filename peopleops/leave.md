navTitle: Vacation & Leave
---

## Vacation Policy

FlowForge has a unlimited time off policy. Taking vacation is encouraged for all
team members. To prevent an undefined number of vacation days to start a race to
the bottom, we recommend each team member to take a minimum of 25 days a year,
and at least 5 days a quarter.

### Logging time off

When taking more than 3 days off consecutively, tell (don't ask) your manager. 
This ensure scheduling of work and operations continue to run smoothly without
you. When taking over 2 weeks of consecutively seek approval from your manager.

Before you can take time off you should _always_:
* Log your time off in BambooHR
* Add an 'Out of office' appointment in your personal Google Calendar, and decline
   all meetings automatically.

#### Sick leave

Sick leave, or having limited availability is not recorded currently. Keep your
manager updated on your health, and let them know what FlowForge can do for you
to aid in your recovery.

## Parental Leave

If you live in a country where a statutory Parental Leave benefit is available,
you will be required to claim statutory Parental Leave pay (if you are eligible).

Any employee can take up to 6-weeks if they wish without requiring manager
approval. We recommend a minimum of 4 weeks, but recognise it's a personal
choice to make. Further leave can be requested, but should be discussed with
your manager.

If you live in a country that offers statutory leave longer than this, then
FlowForge will abide by this.
