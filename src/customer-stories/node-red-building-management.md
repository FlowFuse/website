FlowFuse’s Customer Success Manager, Rob Marcer sat down with PowerWorkplace’s CTO Alan Yeung to discuss how Node-RED and FlowFuse are helping them deliver better results, with a smaller headcount, at a faster pace.

**Rob Marcer:** Thanks for taking the time to talk with me today. Please describe what your company does and how large it is?

**Alan Yeung:** We provide workplace management solutions and tools to empower companies to get better usage of their workspaces. First, we take a consultancy driven approach, we spend time understanding clients' needs, how they use spaces, and what value those spaces provide. Secondly, we create solution proposals including full system integration and design plans. Thirdly, we manage the design and implementation and finally, we provide ongoing support services. We’re focussed on space utilization, environmental monitoring, and we also provide data and analytics around consumption and efficiency.

**Rob Marcer:** How can you quantify the size of your organization?

**Alan Yeung:** We're actually a relatively small organization, around 10 employees, but most of what we do is automated solutions. Once we've implemented services for a customer, it actually doesn't require much in the way of manpower to provide ongoing support. We work with a lot of subcontractors for cabling and hardware installation. At this time we don't have a permanent in-house installation team, we are working with customers in multiple countries so it makes sense for us to outsource to local contractors.

In terms of our scope and scale. We operate throughout Asia Pacific. Despite our small team size, we actually cover a very very large footprint. We cover around 18 physical locations where we have ability to deliver projects. Most of our clients are Global Enterprise, such as large financial institutions. Any organization which has a reasonably large real estate footprint can benefit from the services we provide.

Let's say for example a customer is dealing with 5 floors within each building in multiple buildings across a region. The great thing about the solution we're providing is it’s really easy to scale as a customer adds more floor space, we can take what we’ve put in place at their existing locations and deploy it to new buildings as needed.

**Rob Marcer:** Where does Node-RED fit into your services?

**Alan Yeung:** We deal with lots of different types of physical hardware applications and protocols, and we tend to design very bespoke solutions for clients. This means that we have to deal with a wealth of different types of interface points. In terms of rapid deployment or being able to have the flexibility to introduce new components, Node-RED really is a vital piece to that puzzle. It reduces our time and investment in coding. It allows us to link almost any IOT or cloud data sources and services easily and add additional functionality as needed.

**Rob Marcer:** Where do you host Node-RED?

**Alan Yeung:** It's a mixture, there are Gateway devices for example where we will run Node-RED in a workplace. We might also host Node-RED in a private cloud provided by the customer.

We are a core Microsoft partner, so we have some Node-RED instances hosted in Azure. We're trying to move towards having less dependency on running our own environment because as I mentioned, we're quite a small organization and we want to reduce the amount of time we spend on maintaining our own systems. That's where FlowFuse Cloud is interesting for us because it allows us to focus on growing our business rather than maintaining environments.

**Rob Marcer:** What were you using before Node-RED?

**Alan Yeung:** We’ve used Node-RED almost since the start. Our background is systems integration and Audio Visual installation. We’ve tried working with external development teams but we found that the time-to-value for our development was too slow. Working on Node-RED ourselves allows us to rapidly deliver value as we can spend time on ‘coding’ rather than specification, costing, QA and deployment of new features.

**Rob Marcer:** Can you think of any weaknesses in Node-RED that come to mind for you? 

**Alan Yeung:** Version control could be stronger. If we have multiple people working on a flow it can be hard to spot where a new bug was introduced. We also see situations where Node-RED instances have to be restarted to fix a problem or deploy a new stack. We need to find better ways to manage those admin tasks.

**Rob Marcer:** What's been the impact of Node-RED on your business?

**Alan Yeung:** It's very significant. We're not a development company, that’s not our skill set. We didn’t want to bring in developers and the management they require. We've been very successful in creating a product and a platform with a small and relatively inexperienced team. Without Node-RED, we’d probably still be in an early phase of the product development cycle right now with far less customers and revenue. I think it's probably allowing us to get solutions to customers at least three to five times quicker which is a game changer.

**Rob Marcer:** What technology are you using within your stack that you feel is contributing to your success alongside Node-RED?

**Alan Yeung:** Where possible we use low or no-code solutions, for example we are using Xano as our back-end which allows us to very quickly build our APIs for our own use and all so any third party. That platform is making it very easy to allow access to our data.

**Rob Marcer:** What have been your experiences of using FlowFuse?

**Alan Yeung:** We don't have to focus on scaling or maintaining our environment or ensuring uptime. We can focus on product development, we don't foresee ourselves growing the team significantly, but at the same time, we see our customer acquisition growing exponentially. FlowFuse removes most of our concerns about scalability and reliability.
It’s also making it a lot easier for us to complete security audits for our customers. FlowFuse’s stack is open, widely used and well documented which gives auditors confidence in our applications built on your platform.
