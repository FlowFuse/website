    description:
        - "Fragmented controls and outdated HMI systems mean operators constantly juggle alarms and manual processes. With poor visibility, errors and downtime slip by unnoticed. Customizing old systems takes months and costs a fortune – so teams stick with spreadsheets and sticky notes."
        - "Your line engineers can’t adapt quickly. The result? Alarm fatigue, slow reactions, and missed improvement opportunities."
