problem:
    title: "<span class='text-indigo-600'></span>Manual Plant Management</span> Holding You Back?"
    description:
        - "Most plants – even highly automated ones – still turn to spreadsheets or ad hoc systems for critical coordination. Old MES and MOM tools break down as needs change, leading to bottlenecks, errors, and frustration."
        - "Without real orchestration, reporting and handoffs stay slow and manual. Improvement projects never scale beyond one line or shift, and nobody in the plant has true real-time visibility."
