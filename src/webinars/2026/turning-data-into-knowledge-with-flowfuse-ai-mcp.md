In the industrial space, we are often flooded with data - but while data only tells you the state and outcomes of a system, what operators and managers really need is knowledge and context. Getting that knowledge and context has been an incredibly heavy process, requiring untold hours and manual effort - until now.

<!--more-->

MCP (Model Context Protocol) offers a powerful solution for deploying industrial applications which convert data into knowledge - but in order to leverage it effectively, you need a platform that gives you this benefit alongside security, ease of use, and long-term maintenance. This webinar focuses on how to move beyond raw data and build systems that deliver real operational knowledge — context-rich, reliable, and ready to use across your existing IT and OT stack, diving deep into:

- The core technology behind the MCP stack and how it’s used to connect context to agentic deployments;
- The difference between data and knowledge - and how they must be treated differently and as first-class elements in your system;
- How Node-RED and FlowFuse can deliver agentic solutions at scale; and
- A build process in FlowFuse to connect the FlowFuse Expert to MCP systems in as little as an hour.

This session will give you the ability to understand, deploy, and leverage MCP data to knowledge pipelines in your org the same day you leave it - and will help you understand the tech as well as the deployment modalities it requires. This is a highly interactive webinar with demos and deep dives, so bring your questions, challenges, and notes and take advantage of this one-of-a-kind expert crash course!

If you’re working with data of any kind - industrial or otherwise - and you want to get smarter, faster, and more efficient, you don’t want to miss this exclusive webinar!
