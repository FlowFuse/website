Most AI pilots don’t stall because of modeling. They stall because production deployment is hard.

Turning industrial data into contextual knowledge requires more than dashboards and pipelines — it requires architecture designed for security, scalability, and long-term maintenance.

<!--more-->

This webinar focuses on what that deployment actually looks like using MCP, Node-RED, and FlowFuse — **including a live build connecting FlowFuse Expert to an MCP system in about an hour.**

MCP (Model Context Protocol) offers a powerful way to deploy industrial applications that convert data into contextual knowledge. But leveraging it effectively requires the right platform — one that supports security, ease of use, and long-term maintainability.

In this session, we’ll dive into:

- The core technology behind the MCP stack and how it’s used to connect context to agentic deployments;
- The difference between data and knowledge - and how they must be treated differently and as first-class elements in your system;
- How Node-RED and FlowFuse enable secure, scalable agentic deployments; and
- A build process in FlowFuse to connect the FlowFuse Expert to MCP systems in as little as an hour.

You’ll leave with a clearer understanding of both the technology and the deployment patterns required to implement MCP-based systems in production.

If you're responsible for industrial data pipelines, AI initiatives, or enterprise Node-RED environments, this session is designed for you.
