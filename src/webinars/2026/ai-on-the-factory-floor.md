As AI rapidly enters industrial platforms, teams are left asking an uncomfortable question: is this solving real problems, or just adding complexity?

<!--more-->

This webinar takes a critical look at how AI is being applied across manufacturing, energy, and industrial IoT systems. We will discuss where AI meaningfully augments human expertise, where traditional rules, statistics, or automation still win, and how data quality, context, and domain knowledge determine success or failure. Rather than selling a silver bullet, this talk focuses on practical decision-making so industrial teams can invest in AI with confidence and avoid solutions that look impressive but fail in production.

Over the past few years, artificial intelligence has rapidly made its way into industrial platforms, automation software, and operational workflows. From predictive maintenance and anomaly detection to AI copilots and natural language interfaces, vendors are racing to position AI as the next essential layer of Industry 4.0. 

At the same time, many industrial teams are questioning whether these capabilities are delivering real operational value or simply adding cost, complexity, and risk to already fragile systems. 

In this webinar session, we’ll take a clear-eyed look at AI in industrial environments and ask a simple but critical question: where does AI actually help, and where is it being forced into processes that do not need it? We’ll examine how AI is being applied across manufacturing, industrial IoT, and OT systems, what successful deployments have in common, and why many initiatives fail to move beyond demos and pilots. We’ll also look at why AI has so much push-back in the industrial space - and how to bridge the gap between AI as interesting gimmick and AI as human augmentation superpower.
 
## What’s covered in this session

Our panel of experts will demo implementations of AI in industrial flows and look at:

- Examples where AI works well, such as MCP-augmented discovery and problem solving
- Systems in which AI integration would be a huge negative
- The current state of AI marketing and the hype cycle surrounding it


Whether you are actively deploying AI, considering it for the first time, or skeptical of the promises being made, join us for an honest conversation focused on outcomes, not marketing. Let’s separate real industrial intelligence from expensive buzzwords and talk about what actually works.
