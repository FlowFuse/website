**The journey towards advanced Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) solutions is fraught with challenges, from complex setups and scalability issues to serious security concerns. As industrial sectors evolve, the demand for reliable and secure data access becomes paramount. Typically, operational technology networks are isolated from enterprise networks, often without internet access, to protect critical manufacturing data and systems.**

How can these networks be safely connected to enable better data access and usability? Enter FlowFuse and NCD.io’s Enterprise IIoT Gateway where FlowFuse’s ability to enhance these connections makes getting data from various sources ranging from wind turbines, cooling towers, maritime, to tank farms.

In this webinar, Grey Dziuba, OT Data and Community Strategist, alongside Travis Elliot, COO of NCD.io, will discuss:

- How Node-Red and NCD.io’s technologies can streamline IIoT deployments.
- Best practices for integrating these technologies into your existing infrastructure.
- The extended capabilities of FlowFuse in enhancing the security and scalability of IIoT systems.

This live session is essential for engineers, system integrators, and decision-makers in manufacturing and industrial sectors looking to enhance their IIoT strategies. Join us to discover how to leverage these technologies to not just overcome the traditional challenges but to propel your operations forward securely and efficiently.
