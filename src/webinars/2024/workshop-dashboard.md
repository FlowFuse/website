FlowFuse Dashboard for Node-RED continues to see improvements and new features. In this live Workshop session, Joe Pavitt will demonstrate some of the new features available and how you can use them to build useful User Interfaces.

The session will cover:

- Multi Tenant Dashboards
- Visualizing Data
- Building Custom Templates
- Branding and Styling

...and much more.
