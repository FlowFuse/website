In today's rapidly evolving industrial landscape, real-time data is the key to unlocking operational efficiency and driving innovation.  However, managing and utilizing this data effectively can be a significant challenge. Legacy systems, disparate data sources, and complex integration processes often hinder organizations from harnessing the full potential of their industrial data.

This is where an MQTT Broker can help. It acts as a central hub, facilitating communication between devices and applications by receiving, filtering, and distributing messages. 

In this webinar, we'll introduce the FlowFuse MQTT Broker, a seamless solution that enables you to manage all your MQTT clients, Node-RED instances, and devices from a single, centralized platform, eliminating the need for a separate broker service.

Join Nick Oâ€™Leary, creator of Node-RED and CTO at FlowFuse to learn about
- The advantages of MQTT for industrial communication
- Key features and benefits of the FlowFuse MQTT Broker
- How to integrate FlowFuse with existing industrial systems


They also demo Node-RED flows integrated with dashboards on WAGO hardware.

This webinar is ideal for automation engineers, and operational technology (OT) leaders seeking to optimize their data pipelines and accelerate digital transformation initiatives. Don't miss out on joining us live to gain valuable insights and discover how FlowFuse can revolutionize your approach to real-time data management in the industrial world.
