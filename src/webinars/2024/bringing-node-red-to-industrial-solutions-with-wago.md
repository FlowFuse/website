The industrial automation landscape demands rapid innovation and agility.  However, traditional development methods often struggle to keep pace with evolving requirements.  Node-RED, a powerful low-code tool, offers a solution, enabling engineers to build and deploy applications with speed and efficiency.

In this webinar, we delve into real-world applications of Node-RED within industrial settings, highlighting how WAGO leverages this technology to empower their engineers and accelerate their automation projects.

Nick O'Leary, FlowFuse CTO and Node-RED creator, along with Kurt Braun, Director of Automation Sales Engineering and Development at WAGO, talk about:

- The evolution of Node-RED as a tool for industrial automation
- WAGO's successful use of Node-RED to simplify development and empower engineers
- Real-world case studies and demos showcasing Node-RED's impact in industrial projects
- How FlowFuse enhances Node-RED deployments with enterprise-grade management, scalability, and security

They also demo Node-RED flows integrated with dashboards on WAGO hardware.

This webinar is ideal for automation engineers, industrial system integrators, control systems engineers,  and anyone interested in leveraging low-code development for industrial automation.
