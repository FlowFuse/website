**This webinar showcases how FlowFuse can support production instances of Node-RED and help drive your enterprise initiatives to greater success**

<!--more-->

When it comes to quick proto-typing and small-scale deployments, Node-RED is an ideal open-source tool. With its low-code simplicity, unparalleled protocol connectivity, and backing of a thriving community, it is often the platform of choice for industrial engineers looking to deploy their own solutions without relying too much on IT departments. 

While this bottom-up approach brings agility and innovation, it's crucial to ensure that your Node-RED deployments are enterprise-ready. This means having the right safeguards in place, adhering to compliance frameworks, and ensuring your systems are manageable at scale. 

In this webinar, we address the key challenges of scaling Node-RED for the enterprise and introduce how FlowFuse can take your projects to the next level. 

ZJ van de Weg, CEO of FlowFuse covers
 - How to maintain control and visibility of your Node-RED deployments. 
 - Strategies for managing and scaling your Node-RED flows
 - How to secure your Node-RED environment with features like HTTPS, SSO, and regular updates.

Rob Marcer, Customer Success Manager at FlowFuse, joins ZJ to share real-world examples of how FlowFuse customers are quickly and easily managing their enterprise deployments.  

Whether you're just starting your Node-RED journey or looking to scale your existing projects, this webinar provides valuable insights and practical guidance to project success of your large-scale applications.
