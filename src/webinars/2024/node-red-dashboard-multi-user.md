Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 had recently seen its first major, stable release. In a Webinar, Joe Pavitt demonstrated some of the new features available and, in particular, showed how you could easily build out a multi-user dashboard when running Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 on FlowFuse.

With Node-RED Dashboard 1.0, a very common feature request had been "Personalised Multi-User Dashboards," whereby different data could be rendered in the same dashboard for different users. Now, with the evolution of FlowFuse to elevate your Node-RED experience, you could easily secure your instances with FlowFuse Authentication and utilise this to build out such dashboards.

Joe had demonstrated some of the main features of Node-RED Dashboard 2.0, and then had dived into how you could use these features to:

- Build out a personalized multi-user dashboard, with unique data for each user
- Build admin-only views
- Track user activity for auditing purposes.

There had also been a Q&A session at the end of the Webinar, where attendees could ask any particular questions, queries or feedback they had wanted to discuss directly with the team.
