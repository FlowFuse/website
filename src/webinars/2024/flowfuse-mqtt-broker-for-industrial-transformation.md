**Optimize your industrial processes with FlowFuse MQTT Broker, a new service that simplifies real-time data access.**

<!--more-->

Real-time data is essential for driving operational efficiency and fostering innovation within the industrial sector. Yet, effectively managing and leveraging this data can be a formidable challenge. Legacy systems, fragmented data sources, and intricate integration processes often prevent organizations from fully unlocking the potential of their industrial data.

This is where an MQTT Broker can help. It acts as a central hub, facilitating communication between devices and applications by receiving, filtering, and distributing messages. 

In this webinar, we introduce the FlowFuse MQTT Broker, a seamless solution that enables you to manage all your MQTT clients, Node-RED instances, and devices from a single, centralized platform, eliminating the need for a separate broker service.

Join Nick Oâ€™Leary, creator of Node-RED and CTO at FlowFuse to learn about
- The advantages of MQTT for industrial communication
- Key features and benefits of the FlowFuse MQTT Broker
- How to integrate FlowFuse with existing industrial systems

This webinar is ideal for automation engineers, and operational technology (OT) leaders seeking to optimize their data pipelines and accelerate digital transformation initiatives. Watch the recording or download the slides to gain valuable insights and discover how FlowFuse can revolutionize your approach to real-time data management in the industrial world.
