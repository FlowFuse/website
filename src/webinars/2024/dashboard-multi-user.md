**Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 has recently seen it's first major, stable release. In this Webinar, Joe Pavitt will demonstrate some of the new features available, and in particular, demonstrate how you can easily build out a multi-user Dashboard when running Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 on FlowFuse**

<!--more-->

With Node-RED Dashboard 1.0, a very common feature request was "Multi User Dashboards", now with the evolution of FlowFuse to elevate your Node-RED experience, we can easily secure our instances with FlowFuse Authentication, and utilise this to build out multi-user Dashboards.

Joe will demonstrate some of the main features of Node-RED Dashboard 2.0, and then dive into how you can use these features to build out a multi-user Dashboard, with unique data for each user, build admin-only views, and track user activity for auditing purposes.

We'll also be hosting a Q&A session at the end of the Webinar if you have any particular questions, queries of feedback you'd like to discuss directly with the team.
