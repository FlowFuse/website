What happens to your production line when the network goes down? For engineering teams striving for world-class OEE, the answer is critical: individual cells must keep running in isolation.

This on-demand session teaches you how to design resilient, scalable Node-RED systems that keep your processes running even when connectivity drops. We explore proven architectures for cloud and edge to eliminate single points of failure and boost operational efficiency.

## In this session, we covered:

- **How to decide with confidence** between cloud, edge, or hybrid architectures.
- **Proven ways to eliminate** single points of failure in your automation.
- **Deployment patterns** that work in real-world industrial environments.
- **Use cases from teams** already succeeding with distributed Node-RED at scale.

Choosing the right architecture isn’t just a matter of preference — it has a direct impact on scalability, reliability, and operational efficiency. A single centralized Node-RED instance may seem simple to manage at first, but it can become a bottleneck as workloads grow, introducing risks like a single point of failure or degraded performance.

## What You Will Learn

In the webinar, we covered the pros, cons, and opportunities of various architectures to help you make informed decisions. Key takeaways include how to:

- **Master Cloud-Hosted Node-RED:** Secure your cloud instances, understand how Node-RED scales for larger workloads, and apply design patterns best suited for a cloud environment.
- **Leverage Node-RED at the Edge:** Discover the powerful capabilities available when running Node-RED on edge devices, identify use cases that best fit this architecture, and see how you can implement it yourself.
- **Design Hybrid Systems:** We showed exactly where a split architecture is critical, and how to ensure seamless, secure, and reliable communication between your cloud and edge instances.

## From Strategy to Reality with FlowFuse

While these architectural principles are powerful, implementing them at scale can be complex. In the webinar, we also showed how FlowFuse provides the infrastructure to simplify the management of any distributed architecture.

In this session, you can see how FlowFuse helps you deploy, monitor, and secure your Node-RED instances, whether you choose to run them in the cloud, on-premises, or at the edge. The platform is designed to support your architectural choices, helping your team focus on building great applications, not managing infrastructure.

## Ready to Discuss Your Architecture?

Watching the webinar is a great first step. The next is applying these concepts to your unique environment.

At FlowFuse, we work with engineering teams every day to help:
- Improve resiliency with distributed edge deployments
- Scale Node-RED solutions across teams, sites, and devices
- Gain visibility and control over mission-critical workflows
