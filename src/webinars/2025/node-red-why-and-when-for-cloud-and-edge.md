**Master how to optimize your Node-RED applications for availability, performance and quality.**

Discover the common architectures of FlowFuse customers who are running Node-RED in production environments. 

<!--more-->

With options to host Instances in the Cloud, Self-Host or deploy to the Edge, discover what factors you should be considering when architecting your own deployments.

## Node-RED Architectures

We'll cover the pros, cons, opportunities and limitations of running Node-RED in a variety of different architectures. Specifically, we'll cover:

- **Cloud-Hosted Node-RED:** How can you secure your Node-RED instances in the cloud, how well does Node-RED scale for larger workloads and what design and architectural patterns are best suited to this environment.
- **Node-RED at the Edge:** What capabilities are available when running Node-RED at the edge, what use cases best fit this architecture and how can you go about doing this yourself.

Examples will be shown too that discuss where a split architecture is important, with some Instances running in the Cloud and some running at-Edge, and how best to communicate between these Instances to ensure scalability, reliability and security in your production environments.

## Deploying with FlowFuse

At a higher-level, we'll then explore how FlowFuse provides infrastructure to support management of these different architectures and even cover the choice of where to deploy FlowFuse itself, as that can have architectural consequences, with three core options available:

- **Cloud:** Available to sign up to now, FlowFuse Cloud is our Cloud-hosted Platform and Node-RED Instances are hosted in the Cloud.
- **Self-Hosted:** Where FlowFuse is deployed in the Cloud, and Node-RED Instances are hosted on-premises or in a data centre closest to your users.
- **Dedicated:** Where FlowFuse is deployed in the Cloud, and Node-RED Instances are hosted on-premises or in a data centre closest to your users.

The team will detail example customer projects, exploring the capabilities available with running Node-RED applications on FlowFuse.
