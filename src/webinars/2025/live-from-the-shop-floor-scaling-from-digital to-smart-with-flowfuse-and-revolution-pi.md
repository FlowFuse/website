Watch how a traditional production process becomes truly smart — with connected machines, live data, and automation powered by FlowFuse and [Revolution Pi](https://revolutionpi.com/en/).

Manufacturing companies often struggle with isolated equipment that operates efficiently but lacks connectivity to broader business systems. While tools, workplaces and machines perform their specific tasks well, the missing link between shop floor operations and enterprise systems creates data silos, manual processes, and missed opportunities for optimization. Bridging OT and IT eliminates manual data entry, reduces errors, accelerates order fulfillment, and gives you the real-time insights needed to make faster, better business decisions.

In this webinar, Boris Crismancich from Revolution Pi was live at scale expert [Essmann Waagen](https://essmann.com/en/), demonstrating how FlowFuse and Revolution Pi connect a traditional counting scale workflow to a modern, governed automation environment.

You’ll see how FlowFuse’s scalable, low-code platform built on Node-RED brings structure and reliability to industrial automation — connecting legacy equipment, standardizing data flows, and enabling secure, governed operations across the shop floor. Together with Revolution Pi’s industrial hardware, he showed how open, interoperable technologies can bridge the IT/OT gap and unlock hidden operational potential with maximum efficiency and flexibility.

## Key Topics

- Real-world challenges of industrial digitalization and how to overcome them cost-effectively
- Loading and structuring ERP-exported order data inside Node-RED
- Connecting legacy equipment to modern workflows using FlowFuse and Revolution Pi
- Working with barcode-based workflows using Dashboard 2.0
- Best practices for creating scalable, future-proof industrial architectures
- How to achieve quick wins while building toward comprehensive digital transformation

## Live Demo

Watch how Boris connected an isolated counting scale into a live workflow — including ERP-exported order data, order selection, barcode input, and real-time scale integration using Node-RED, FlowFuse, and Revolution Pi.

## What comes next?

If you're exploring how to:  
- connect machines and systems across protocols,  
- unify and structure operational data,  
- deploy and govern Node-RED applications across multiple locations, or  
- modernize production workflows without custom integration overhead,  

FlowFuse can help you move from isolated processes to fully connected operations with reliability, security, and scale.
