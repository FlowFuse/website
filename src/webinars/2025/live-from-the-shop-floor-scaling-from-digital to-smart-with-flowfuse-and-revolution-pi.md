Manufacturing companies often struggle with isolated equipment that operates efficiently but lacks connectivity to broader business systems. While tools, workplaces and machines perform their specific tasks well, the missing link between shop floor operations and enterprise systems creates data silos, manual processes, and missed opportunities for optimization. Bridging OT and IT eliminates manual data entry, reduces errors, accelerates order fulfillment, and gives you the real-time insights needed to make faster, better business decisions.

In this webinar, Boris Crismancich from Revolution Pi, will be live at scale expert [Essmann Waagen](https://essmann.com/en/), demonstrating how FlowFuse and Revolution Pi transform a traditional counting scale workflow into a smart, ERP-connected system.

You’ll see how FlowFuse’s scalable, low-code platform built on Node-RED brings structure and reliability to industrial automation — connecting legacy equipment, standardizing data flows, and enabling secure, governed operations across the shop floor. Together with Revolution Pi’s industrial hardware, he’ll show how open, interoperable technologies can bridge the IT/OT gap and unlock hidden operational potential with maximum efficiency and flexibility.

## Key Topics

- Real-world challenges of industrial digitalization and how to overcome them cost-effectively
- Live build of an automated warehouse picking process with ERP integration
- Connecting legacy equipment to modern workflows using Node-RED and Revolution Pi
- Implementing AI-powered quality control with camera vision on the edge
- Best practices for creating scalable, future-proof industrial architectures
- How to achieve quick wins while building toward comprehensive digital transformation


## Live Demo
