Fragmented data architectures, incompatible protocols, and complex security requirements create major challenges for modern industrial systems. OPC UA has become a reliable standard for connecting devices, ensuring data integrity, and creating flexible architectures that both human operators and AI systems can rely on.

<!--more-->
Explore the technical complexities of enterprise OPC UA deployment and see practical approaches using Node-RED, leveraging FlowFuse’s features to help scale and manage these deployments effectively, with specialized B2B packages. Learn how to construct OPC UA information models, implement certificate-based authentication, and build architect robust data flow management systems.

See practical demonstrations, including connecting machines to dashboards and integrating MQTT for bridging OT and IT domains.

## What You'll Learn

Gain practical understanding of:

- OPC UA fundamentals and industrial automation applications
- Common deployment challenges and architectural solutions
- Package installation methods via Node-RED catalog, FlowFuse configurations, and Docker
- Technical implementation of:
    - Information modeling techniques
    - X.509 certificate authentication
    - Enterprise workflow patterns
    - Security profile configuration


## Technical Topics Covered
- **Security Architecture:** Understanding OPC UA security profiles, certificate management principles, and encryption implementation
- **Performance Optimization:** Analyzing subscription management patterns and bulk operation handling for high-throughput scenarios
- **Configuration Methodologies:** Auto-discovery mechanisms, browsing capabilities, and data type mapping strategies
- **Advanced Features:** Working with complex data types, methods, alarms, conditions, and historical data access patterns
- **Operational Reliability:** Implementing logging strategies, connection monitoring, and automatic recovery mechanisms
- **Version Management:** Understanding LTS strategies for industrial environments and security patch management 

## This webinar is ideal for:

Automation engineers, system integrators, and developers working with industrial IoT systems who want to deepen their understanding of OPC UA implementation patterns.

By the end of this session, you’ll know how to securely connect things to a Node-RED instance and Dashboard by using OPC UA and MQTT, and understand when this approach makes sense for your industrial projects.

If you'd like to dig deeper, Klaus has shared the [flows he built for the demo](./opc-ua-webinar-flows.zip). Keep in mind that he used the [P4NR (PLUS for Node-RED)](https://p4nr.com/) package for many of them.
