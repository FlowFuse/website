Heavy-duty industries depend on real-time visibility and connected systems to stay efficient, safe, and resilient.  

In this webinar, **Raymond Macaisa, Design Engineering Manager at Red Sea Gateway Terminal**, highlights how they transformed their operations by unifying IT and OT systems—bridging legacy infrastructure with modern, low-code automation.  

<!--more-->

Using Node-RED, [Red Sea Gateway Terminal](https://rsgt.com/) implemented low-code integrations for gate automation, weighbridge operations, and RFID-based truck and tractor tracking—connecting MSSQL databases, TOS data, truck telemetry APIs, and SNMP monitoring for access points into a single unified workflow. FlowFuse enabled deployment with CI/CD pipelines, redundancy, and high availability for these mission-critical processes.

The terminal further enhanced operational visibility by integrating Node-RED flows into a 3D Three.js-based digital twin, providing real-time monitoring and supporting better decision-making. Previous use cases—such as RFID-based gate automation, weighbridge integration, dashboard visualization, and automated thermal receipt/PDF printing—demonstrate how flexible, scalable, and cost-effective these solutions can be in heavy-duty industrial environments.

## Key Topics

- **Integration of Remote Weighbridges** into the corporate Terminal Operating System using Node-RED and FlowFuse.
- **Tracking of Terminal Tractors** with RFID readers and tags, with live TOS integration.
- **FlowFuse for On-Premise Instance Management** including setup, redundancy, and high availability.
- **Node-RED Capabilities** for serial port communication, automation, and dashboarding.
- **Data Integration**, ingesting and managing multiple sources—SNMP, APIs, MSSQL—into unified workflows.
- **CI/CD Deployment Strategies** for reliable and scalable OT automation.

## Demo

The session will include a live demonstration of:

- **FlowFuse Dashboard 2.0** for operational monitoring.
- **Automated ticket printing** using TCP nodes for thermal receipt printers.
- **PDFMaker integration** to generate digital transaction reports.

## Target Audience

- Terminal Operators, Port Engineers, and IT/OT Managers seeking to modernize legacy systems.
- Industrial Automation Professionals interested in scalable and open-source integration solutions.
- Developers and Engineers exploring real-world use of Node-RED and FlowFuse in mission-critical environments.

Don’t miss this opportunity to see how Red Sea Gateway Terminal transformed container terminal operations, leveraging FlowFuse to achieve greater efficiency, visibility, and resilience through IT/OT integration and automation.
