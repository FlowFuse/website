Join this team of industrial automation experts for a round-table discussion on the recent acquisition of PTC’s Kepware and ThingWorx platforms by private equity group TPG - diving into the reasons for the purchase, how it affects current customers, and what it means for the future of Industry 4.0 connectivity.

<!--more-->

In November of 2025, PTC announced the $600M USD sale of its Kepware and ThingWorx platforms to private equity group TPG in a deal expected to close in early 2026. As PTC realigns its business around its core CAD/PLM vision and TPG brings its profit-driven approach to the IIoT space, industrial teams face a critical moment - with a rapidly consolidating market and growing concerns about vendor lock-in, teams now have to reconsider their industrial connectivity strategies.

In this roundtable discussion, we’ll explore how this acquisition came to be, what it means to the industrial connectivity market, and what current users should expect in the coming months. We’ll analyze the risks and opportunities that this sale creates, and discuss practical strategies and solutions for engineering leaders - including the growing case for open-source alternatives.

 
## Key Topics

Our internal expert panel featuring Kristopher Sandoval (moderator), ZJ van der Weg, Nick O'Leary, and Drew Gatti will discuss:

- How this sale came to be and why PTC is divesting from Kepware and ThingWorx.
- What this sale means for the industry at large and for direct customers.
- Whether this sale is part of a larger trend - and what that trend might mean for the industry.
- The elephant in the room - closed-source versus open-source solutions in an era of corporate consolidation.
- The future of Industry 4.0.

This webinar is ideal for CIOs, OT directors, plant engineers, and technical leaders in manufacturing and industrial sectors who are evaluating their connectivity strategies. Whether you're currently using Kepware/ThingWorx or exploring alternatives, join us to understand the market shifts and discover actionable strategies to future-proof your industrial data infrastructure. Let’s try to answer the big 2026 question all together: what’s next?
