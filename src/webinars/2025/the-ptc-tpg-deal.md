In this on-demand roundtable, FlowFuse experts discuss the implications of PTC’s $600M sale of Kepware and ThingWorx to private equity firm TPG—and what this shift signals for the future of industrial connectivity.

<!--more-->

While the deal raises immediate questions for existing Kepware and ThingWorx customers, the conversation goes deeper. The panel examines broader industry trends, including market consolidation, vendor lock-in, and the growing tension between closed-source and open-source approaches to industrial software.

Whether you’re directly impacted by this acquisition or simply planning your next-generation connectivity strategy, this session provides practical insight into what’s changing—and how teams can prepare for 2026 and beyond.

 
## What’s covered in this session

In this roundtable discussion, the panel explores:

- How this sale came to be and why PTC is divesting from Kepware and ThingWorx.
- What this sale means for the industry at large and for direct customers.
- Whether this sale is part of a larger trend - and what that trend might mean for the industry.
- The elephant in the room - closed-source versus open-source solutions in an era of corporate consolidation.
- The future of Industry 4.0.

This webinar is ideal for CIOs, OT directors, plant engineers, and technical leaders in manufacturing and industrial sectors who are evaluating their connectivity strategies. Whether you’re currently running Kepware or ThingWorx—or exploring alternative approaches—this discussion helps frame the decisions ahead and the tradeoffs teams need to consider.
