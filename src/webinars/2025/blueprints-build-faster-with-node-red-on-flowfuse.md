## What You'll Learn

Watch Steve McLaughlin as he demonstrates how to:

- Quickly deploy pre-built Blueprints for real-world use cases like:
  - **PDF Report Generator**
  - **OEE Dashboards** for **SCADA** systems
  - **AI-powered agents** interacting via Node-RED
- Reduce your dependency on expensive and complex software by using Node-RED and FlowFuse as a more **flexible, cost-effective solution**

Steve also shares insights into the process FlowFuse uses to develop Blueprints, designed to balance ease of use with providing real value for your projects.

Whether you're automating factory processes, building IoT solutions, or streamlining internal tools, this session will show you how FlowFuse Blueprints help you move faster and get more value from your applications.

## You’ll Get the Most Value If You’re…

- A Node-RED user looking to speed up development and discover new capabilities
- An Engineer or developer in industrial environments who wants to simplify operations, find cost-effective solutions, and avoid vendor lock-in.
- Or just seeking to build smarter, faster applications without starting from scratch

Watch now and learn how to build smarter, faster, and more efficiently with FlowFuse and Node-RED.
