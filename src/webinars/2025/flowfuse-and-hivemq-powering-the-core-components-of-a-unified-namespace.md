**Watch this webinar to learn how to use FlowFuse (Node-RED) and HiveMQ (MQTT) platforms to build a Unified Namespace (UNS) that integrates enterprise and control domain data for improved production scheduling and machine performance monitoring.**

Manufacturers undergoing digital transformation often struggle to scale their data initiatives due to rigid point-to-point architectures, inconsistent data formats, and the absence of a unified data ecosystemâ€”leading to complexity in data access and utilization.

The Unified Namespace (UNS) solves this by using a decoupled architecture to break down data silos and enable flexible OT/IT integration, providing a standardized interface for seamless data access across the entire manufacturing operation.

In this session, Kudzai Manditereza, a leading expert in Unified Namespace, explores and demonstrates how to implement UNS for OT/IT data interoperability using FlowFuse (Node-RED) and HiveMQ (MQTT).

Key topics include:
- Understanding the core components of a Unified Namespace and how FlowFuse and HiveMQ powers it.
- Understanding the Edge-to-Cloud UNS architecture with FlowFuse and HiveMQ.
- Integrating work orders from Enterprise SQL database to shop-floor work units.
- Assigning work orders to relevant machines and providing Operator visualizations.
- Collect, contextualize and store production equipment data to track Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE).
- Building OEE visualization dashboards for plant and line managers.

This webinar is ideal for IIoT Solution Architects and Digital Manufacturing professionals looking to lay a solid foundation for digital transformation strategies in their organizations. 

Don't miss this opportunity to see practical demonstrations and gain insights into leveraging UNS for manufacturing efficiency.
