**Join Quintijn Steelant (Digital Manufacturing Consultant) and Alejandro Simo (IT OT Architect) from the [Mayker](https://mayker.eu/) team in this session to learn how FlowFuse helps build a future-proof UNS for seamless IT/OT integration.**

<!--more-->

Industrial organisations face significant challenges connecting IT and OT systems due to fragmented architectures, inconsistent data formats, and limited scalability. Without a Unified Namespace (UNS), manufacturers struggle with siloed data, leading to inefficiencies and operational blind spots.

Key topics include:
- Common challenges in IT/OT integration and why UNS is critical.
- The role of UNS in enabling scalable and real-time industrial data access.
- How FlowFuse supports UNS with low-code integration, edge-to-cloud connectivity, and event-driven processing.
- Real-world case studies showcasing efficiency improvements and reduced downtime.
- Practical steps for implementation and key pitfalls to avoid

This session is a must for **IIoT Solution Architects, Digital Manufacturing professionals, and IT/OT leaders** looking to build a robust data architecture that scales with their digital transformation initiatives.

Join us to discover how FlowFuse enables a flexible, future-proof UNS architecture and learn practical implementation strategies. Donâ€™t miss this opportunity to gain valuable insights and have your questions answered by industry experts!
