**OPC-UA is a popular communication protocol used to communicate industrial data between different types of hardware and software. Many of the popular industrial automation PLCs vendors support an OPC server running on their hardware. Node-RED is a great low-code platform for creating an OPC client to consume the data from these PLCs.**

In this webinar, we will introduce the OPC-UA nodes for creating an OPC client in Node-RED and take you through the steps to read data from an OPC server and visualize the data in Node-RED. Leading our webinar this month will be Mika Karaila, Research Director at Valmet Automation and creator of the Node-RED OPC-UA nodes. Mika will demonstrate how to get started with the OPC-UA nodes and discuss the different options for interacting between an OPC client and server.

Attendees of the webinar will learn the following:
- Understand the high level architecture and components of OPC-UA.
- Learn how to connect with an OPC server.
- Discover the steps for creating an OPC client inside Node-RED.
