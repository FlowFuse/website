**Node-RED makes it very easy to connect industrial equipment so that data can be visualized to understand common production metrics like OEE, performance, cycle times etc.**

<!--more-->

In this webinar, attendees will learn how to create a Node-RED flow to:
- Connect to an existing PLC using an industrial protocol
- Integrate data from an external MQTT broker
- Create a dashboard to visualize common production metrics
- Sanitize data for recording in a database
- Generate a report from recorded data

This webinar will include a live demonstration of how to set up Node-RED to accomplish the tasks listed above. Attendees are expected to have a general understanding of Node-RED.

To attend the webinar please register in advance.
