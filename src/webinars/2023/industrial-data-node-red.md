**Node-RED makes it very easy to connect industrial equipment so that data can be visualized to understand common production metrics like OEE, performance, cycle times etc. **

<!--more-->

In this webinar, attendees will learn how to create a Node-RED flow to:
Connect to an existing PLC using Modbus
Integrate data from an external source
Create a dashboard to visualize common production metrics
Filter the data to report by exception and store this data in a [InfluxDB] database.

This webinar will be a live demonstration of how to set up Node-RED to accomplish the tasks listed above. A general understanding of Node-RED will be expected.
