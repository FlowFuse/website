## What is the Debug node used for in Node-RED?

The Debug node is useful for understanding the message and data being generated and transposed by your flows. During development, it is recommended to add Debug nodes at key points in your flow to have a view on the messages that are being passed through the flow. 

The debug messages can be viewed in the right-hand side panel, under the debug icon.
