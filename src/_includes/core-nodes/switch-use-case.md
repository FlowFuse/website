## What's the Switch node in Node-RED used for?

The Switch node in Node-RED allows you to route messages based on certain conditions. It allows you to direct the flow of data to different output paths depending on the content of the incoming message. This node is particularly useful for filtering and processing data dynamically in your flow. It is similar to the Switch statement in JavaScript.


## Example

A simple example of a Switch node that sets the Day or Night mode based on the ambient light.
