## Where and why do we use the Batch node?

The Batch node is used to group sequences of messages into batches.

## Modes of operation

### Group by Number of Messages

The Batch node can be configured to group messages into batches based on the number of messages in a batch. 

For example, if you set the batch size to 5, then the first 5 messages will be grouped into a batch before being released. Then the next 5 messages will be grouped into a batch, and so on.

See the below example flow for what this looks like in practice.

![Batching messages into 5 groups](./images/batch-example1.png)

Additionally, you can add overlap so that the last message is included in the next batch

### Group by Time Interval

The Batch node can be configured to group messages into batches based on a time period.

For example, if you set the batch time to 2 seconds, then all messages received within 2 seconds will be grouped into a batch before being released.
Then the next batch will be created for the next 2 seconds, and so on.

See the below example flow for what this looks like in practice.

### Concatenate sequences

The Batch node can be configured to concatenate message sequences into a single message.

For example, you could use this to duplicate the sequence of messages in a sequence or order them by topic. 

See the below example flow for what this looks like in practice.
