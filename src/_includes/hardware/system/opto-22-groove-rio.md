### Installing FlowFuse Device Agent

Before starting the installation, it is recommended to update your system to
ensure that all your packages are up to date. You can use groov manage, which
acts as the command central for your groov RIO devices. For detailed
instructions on how to update the system, [watch this video](https://www.opto22.com/support/resources-tools/videos/playlist-what-is-groov-epic?wchannelid=61lkudfc8c&wmediaid=mxzzp2kudx).

This guide is written for the firmware version of: `4.0.2-b.194`. Node.JS 20 is
available on the device, and you should be good to go to register the edge device
on FlowFuse.
