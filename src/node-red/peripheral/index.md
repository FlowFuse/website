# Peripheral Devices

Node-RED supports a wide range of peripheral devices, allowing users to connect Node-RED to many external inputs and outputs. This enables the creation of interactive and automated systems where data from peripheral devices can trigger actions or responses in the digital realm. By bridging the gap between software and hardware, Node-RED expands its applicability to a wide range of use cases.
