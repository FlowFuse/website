# {{ meta.title }}

This document lists and explains the **MCP nodes** available in FlowFuse. MCP (Model Context Protocol) nodes extend Node-RED to integrate AI models, tools, and resources through the MCP framework. Each node helps you connect, configure, and manage model interactions directly from Node-RED.

## Nodes

This section lists the **MCP nodes** available in FlowFuse:

Each listed node provides a unique capability within the MCP ecosystem â€” from registering tools and resources to managing prompts and responses. Use these nodes to create MCP Servers, provide tools, resources, and prompts to MCP Clients, and standardize model workflows in your Node-RED projects.
