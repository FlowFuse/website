# {{ meta.title }}

This document lists and explains the **MCP nodes** available in FlowFuse. MCP (Model Context Protocol) nodes extend Node-RED to integrate AI models, tools, and resources through the MCP framework. Each node helps you connect, configure, and manage model interactions directly from Node-RED.
