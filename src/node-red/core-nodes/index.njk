<h1>Node-RED Core Nodes</h1>

<p>In Node-RED, the core nodes are the set of nodes that are included with the
Node-RED runtime by default without the node install procedure. These nodes are
maintained and supported by the Node-RED development team and are intended to
provide the basic building blocks for creating Node-RED flows.</p>

<p>Core nodes include nodes for basic functionality like input/output, processing,
and control flow. They are the foundation upon which more complex workflows can
be built, and they are essential to the operation of Node-RED.</p>

<p>The nodes are grouped in a few sections in the nodes sidebar:
<ol type="1">
    <li>common - miscellaneous nodes</li>
    <li>function - Control flow, blocking or sending additional messages</li>
    <li>network - Receive and send messages over the network on different protocols</li>
    <li>sequence - Working with collections of messages, or creating them</li>
    <li>parser - transforming data from one format to another</li>
    <li>storage - for reading or writing files</li>
</ol>
