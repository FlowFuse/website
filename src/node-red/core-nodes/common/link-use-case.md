# Node-RED Link Node

## What's the Link node in Node-RED used for?
The Link In and Link Out nodes are used to help Node-RED developers to organize their flows to make them easier to understand. The Link nodes can be used to connect two sets of Nodes but the connection is only shown when one of the nodes is selected.  This allows developers to group nodes together that complete a specific function. The Link node will connect two groups together but visually it isn't apparent until one of the nodes is selected.


## Examples
