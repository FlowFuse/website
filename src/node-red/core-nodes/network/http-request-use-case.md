# Node-RED HTTP request Node

## What are HTTP request nodes used for in Node-RED

In Node-RED, an HTTP Request node allows you to make HTTP requests to external servers or services. This allows you to interact with web services, APIs, or any other HTTP-based endpoints.

When you configure an HTTP Request node, you typically specify the method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, among others), the URL of the endpoint you want to communicate with, any headers you need to include, and the payload if applicable. Once configured, this node will send the HTTP request when triggered by an incoming message or event.
