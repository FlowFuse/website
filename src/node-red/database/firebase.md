# {{meta.title}}

Firebase provides two database options: Realtime Database (RTDB) and Cloud Firestore. This guide focuses on Cloud Firestore, Firebase's newer, more flexible document database with better performance, richer queries, and multi-regional support.

Cloud Firestore is a scalable NoSQL document database that offers real-time synchronization, offline support, and seamless integration with Node-RED. Using this combination, developers can build event-driven flows for IoT dashboards, notifications, and synchronized device management.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- **Node-RED instance**: Ensure you have a running Node-RED instance. The quickest and easiest way to set up Node-RED is via FlowFuse. [Sign up](https://app.flowforge.com/account/create/) to get started. Once you have a FlowFuse instance, you can easily manage, deploy, scale, and collaborate with your team on flows securely.
- **Firebase account**: You will need a Firebase account with the necessary configuration details to create projects and access Cloud Firestore.

## Step 1: Install the Cloud Firestore Node-RED Package

To connect Node-RED with Cloud Firestore, you need to install the required Node-RED node.

1. Open your Node-RED editor.
2. Go to **Menu → Manage palette → Install**.
3. In the search box, enter: `@gogovega/node-red-contrib-cloud-firestore`
4. Click **Install** next to the package.
5. After installation, restart your Node-RED instance to ensure the configuration node loads properly.
6. The Firestore nodes will appear in your palette, ready to use in your flows.

## Step 2: Configure the Firestore Node

Once the Firestore nodes are installed, you need to configure them with your Firebase project credentials.

1. Drag a Firestore node (e.g., Firestore Out node) onto the Node-RED canvas.
2. Double-click the node to open its configuration panel.
3. Click the **+** icon next to the **Database** field to add a new configuration.
4. In the **Authentication** tab:
   * Select **Email/Password** as the authentication type.
   * Enter your Firebase **API key** (from your project's web app settings).
   * Enter the **email** and **password** of a Firebase user with access to Firestore.
5. In the **Database** section:
   * Enter your **Firebase Project ID**.
6. Click **Done** to save the configuration.

> **Security Note**: Keep your credentials secure. Avoid exposing your API key, email, or password publicly. When sharing flows, use [environment variables](https://flowfuse.com/blog/2023/01/environment-variables-in-node-red/) to keep sensitive information safe.

## Step 3: Create a Document

Before sending data from Node-RED, you need a collection where the data will be stored. Firestore organizes data in documents within collections.

1. Drag a **Firestore Out** node onto the Node-RED canvas.
2. Double-click the node to open its configuration panel.
3. Select the **Firestore configuration** you created in Step 2.
4. Set the **Operation** to `Set / Create Document`.
5. Enter the **Collection** name and **Document ID**:
   * You can enter them as static strings, e.g., `devices` and `raspberry_pi_5_01`.
   * Or you can set them dynamically using `msg.collection` and `msg.document`.
6. Drag an **Inject** node onto the canvas and connect it to the Firestore node. Configure the payload data you want to store. For example, set `msg.payload` to:

```json
{
  "device_id": "device_001",
  "status": "online",
  "last_seen": "2025-09-22T13:10:00Z",
  "location": "Room 101"
}
```

7. Click **Done** to save the configuration.
8. Deploy the flow.

To test, click the **Inject** button on the Inject node to send the data to Firestore. You should see the Firestore node update its status:

* **Querying…** – Node-RED is sending the data to Firestore.
* **Done** – Data has been successfully written to your collection.

## Step 4: Updating a Document

Updating an existing document in Firestore lets you change one or more fields without replacing the entire document.

1. Drag a **Firestore Out** node onto the Node-RED canvas.
2. Double-click the node to open its configuration panel.
3. Select the **Firestore configuration** you created earlier.
4. Set the **Operation** to `Update Document`.
5. Specify the **Collection** name and the **Document ID** you want to update.
   * Example: `devices` and `raspberry_pi_5_01`.
6. Connect an **Inject** node to provide the updated data. For example, set `msg.payload` to:

```json
{
  "status": "offline",
  "last_seen": "2025-09-23T11:45:00Z"
}
```

7. Deploy the flow.
8. Click the **Inject** button. The Firestore node will update the specified fields in the document.

> **Note**: Fields not included in `msg.payload` will remain unchanged.

## Step 5: Deleting a Document

To remove a document from a Firestore collection:

1. Drag another **Firestore Out** node onto the Node-RED canvas.
2. Double-click the node to open its configuration panel.
3. Select your Firestore configuration.
4. Set the **Operation** to `Delete Document`.
5. Enter the **Collection** and **Document ID** to delete.
   * Example: `devices` and `raspberry_pi_5_01`.
6. Connect an **Inject** node to trigger the deletion.
7. Deploy the flow and click the **Inject** button.

Once executed, the specified document will be permanently removed from the collection.

## Step 6: Reading Data from Firestore

The **Firestore Get** node allows Node-RED to read data from a Firestore collection or document. This is useful for dashboards, data processing, or one-time data retrieval.

1. Drag a **Firestore Get** node onto the Node-RED canvas.
2. Double-click the node to open its configuration panel.
3. Select the **Firestore configuration** you created in Step 2.
4. Choose the **Type**:
   * **Collection** – Reads all documents within a single collection.
   * **Collection Group** – Reads documents across multiple collections with the same name.
     > If **Collection** or **Collection Group** is selected, specify the name in the **Collection / Group** field.
   * **Document** – Reads a single document.
     > If **Document** is selected, specify the **Collection** and **Document ID**. You can also enter them together in a single field using the format `collectionName/documentName`.
5. To sort or filter your data, check the option **"Do you want to sort and order your data?"**. Then configure the query constraints, such as:
   * `limitToFirst` or `limitToLast` – Limit the number of results returned.
   * `startAt` / `startAfter` – Start the query at a specific value.
   * `endAt` / `endBefore` – End the query at a specific value.
   * `orderBy` – Sort documents by a specific field.
   * `where` – Apply filters to select specific documents.
6. Connect a Debug node to the Firestore node to monitor the output and deploy the flow.

## Step 7: Listening for Real-time Changes

Unlike the **Firestore Get** node, which retrieves data only once, the **Firestore In** node establishes a real-time listener. This means Node-RED will continuously receive updates whenever documents are **added**, **modified**, or **removed** in the specified collection, collection group, or document.

This capability is particularly useful for building live dashboards, sending notifications, or keeping device states synchronized without repeatedly polling the database.

1. Drag a **Firestore In** node onto the Node-RED canvas.
2. Double-click the node to open its configuration panel.
3. Select the **Firestore configuration** you created in Step 2.
4. Choose the **Type**:
   * **Collection** – Listens to all documents within a single collection.
   * **Collection Group** – Listens to documents across multiple collections with the same name.
     > If **Collection** or **Collection Group** is selected, specify the name in the **Collection / Group** field.
   * **Document** – Listens to changes in a single document.
     > If **Document** is selected, specify the **Collection** and **Document ID**. You can also enter them together in a single field using the format `collectionName/documentName`.
5. When **Collection** or **Collection Group** is selected, choose the type of changes you want to listen for with the **filter** field:
   * **Added documents**
   * **Modified documents**
   * **Removed documents**
6. To refine your listener, enable **"Do you want to sort and order your data?"** and configure query constraints such as:
   * `limitToFirst` or `limitToLast` – Limit the number of results returned.
   * `startAt` / `startAfter` – Start the query at a specific value.
   * `endAt` / `endBefore` – End the query at a specific value.
   * `orderBy` – Sort documents by a specific field.
   * `where` – Apply filters to select specific documents.
7. Connect a Debug node to the Firestore node to monitor the output and deploy the flow.
