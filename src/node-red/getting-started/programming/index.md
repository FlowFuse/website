# {{ meta.title }}

Learn the core programming concepts you'll use every day in Node-RED. This section covers the fundamental building blocks that will help you create more sophisticated and reliable flows.

## What's Covered

Programming in Node-RED means working with flows, nodes, and messages. Even though you're working visually, you'll still need to understand key programming concepts like conditional logic, loops, and data manipulation. This section teaches you how to implement these concepts using Node-RED's visual approach.
