# {{meta.title}}

The Node-RED editor header is a central component that facilitates navigation to Node-RED main settings, provides a deploy button for executing flows, and access to the user profile.

![Node-RED Editor Header](./images/header.png "Node-RED Editor Header"){data-zoomable}

## Node-RED Instance Name

Clicking on the left instance name redirects you to that instance's advanced options provided by the [FlowFuse Cloud](https://flowfuse.com/). These options include overview, edge devices assigned to that instance, audit logs for monitoring instance activities, settings and more.

![FlowFuse Instance Option](./images/header-flowfuse-instance.png "FlowFuse Instance Option; click to redirect to instance on platform"){data-zoomable}

For more information, refer to the [FlowFuse Instance](/docs/user/introduction/#working-with-instances).

# Deploy Button

On the right-hand side of the header, you will find a red deploy button. Clicking on it executes all flows within the instance. The red color indicates pending changes to deploy, while gray indicates no pending changes.

![Active Deploy Button](./images/deploy-button-active.png "Active Deploy Button"){data-zoomable}

![Inactive Deploy Button](./images/deploy-button-inactive.png "Inactive Deploy Button indicating no changes to deploy"){data-zoomable}

To deploy only modified flows or nodes, or to stop/restart flow execution, click the deploy button's expand icon. Select your preferred option and then click the deploy button accordingly.

![Deploy Button Expand Icon and Options](./images/deploy-button-options.png "Deploy Button Expand Icon and Options"){data-zoomable}

## User Profile 

After the deploy button, you will see the profile icon. Clicking on it allows you to view your FlowFuse username and provides options to log out from that particular instance. This action redirects you to the advanced options provided by the FlowFuse platform, similar to clicking on the instance name.

## Main Menu

Right after the user profile, you will see the menu icon at the right-hand corner. Clicking on it will open the list of options that make working with Node-RED.

Following are the option available in the main menu

- **New Flow**: Choosing "New Flow" will create a new workspace for the imported flow upon clicking the import button.

On the left-hand side, you will find three options after the clipboard:

- **Local Library**: Here, you can browse the local flow library, which contains flows created within the same Node-RED instance. This library is accessible only from the same instance where the flows were created.
- **Examples**: This section contains the examples flows for all of the core nodes as well as the third-party nodes you have installed if they have added.
- **Team Library**: This section allows you to browse flow collection that are shared across all Node-RED instances within your team.

### Export

This option allows you to export the application flow that you have created. It generally provides two main options: "Copy to Clipboard," which allows you to copy the `flow.json`, and "Download," which downloads the `flow.json` file.
