# Hardware

FlowFuse supports a wide range of hardware devices to allow users to connect Node-RED to many devices and sensors. This allows for the creation of interactive and automated systems, where data from physical inputs can trigger actions or responses in the digital realm. By bridging the gap between software and hardware, Node-RED expands its applicability to a wide range of use cases.
