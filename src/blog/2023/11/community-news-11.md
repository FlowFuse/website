## TLDR

We're excited to share some significant enhancements that will elevate your experience with FlowFuse and Node-RED. We've announced that Dashboards 2.0 are in Beta version.  Recent additions to Dashboards 2.0 include integrating Vuetify and Mermaid into Dashboard 2.0 unlocking a suite of custom UI components to enrich your dashboards. Our step-by-step guide will walk you through creating dynamic elements like countdown timers, leveraging the power of VueJS for seamless updates.

We're also thrilled to introduce FlowFuse Blueprints - a game-changer in building bespoke, flexible, and resilient manufacturing applications. Our initial set of Blueprints, including ANDON Operator Terminal, Performance Overview Dashboard, and OEE Calculator, provide preconfigured Node-RED applications that streamline your development process. Dive into the world of Blueprints and discover how they can accelerate your project's journey from concept to operational reality.  Join the [webinar](/webinars/2023/blueprints/) to find out more.
