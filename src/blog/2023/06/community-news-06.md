## From the Community

Jsonata is a very useful and often underutilised tool built into Node-RED. Steve over at [Steve's Node-RED Guide](https://stevesnoderedguide.com) has published a great beginners guide. If you are new to Jsonata and want to learn more we recommend you [take a look](https://stevesnoderedguide.com/node-red-and-jsonata-for-beginners).

### Custom Node Spotlight - node-red-contrib-queue-gate

[Queue Gate](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-queue-gate) is a handy custom node which allows you to control the flow of messages. You might wish to queue up all the messages in a flow and then release them all, once an hour. Maybe you want to release just one message at a time and wait until the prior message completed a section of your flow. Queue Gate makes message queuing really easy without the need to use an external queue solution.
