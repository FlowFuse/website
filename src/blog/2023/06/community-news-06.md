Welcome to the FlowFuse newsletter for June 2023, a monthly roundup of what’s been happening with both FlowFuse and the wider Node-RED community. 

<!--more-->

## New Release

This week we released FlowFuse 1.8, featuring high availability for Node-RED and DevOps software delivery pipelines. Both these features were in high demand from our community and will make it easier to reliably deliver Node-RED for business critical applications.

 Read about the details of FlowFuse 1.8 in our [release announcement](/blog/2023/06/flowforge-1-8-released/). 

## Upcoming events

### Building Node-RED Applications for Scalability and High Availability

Our June webinar will focus on the new FlowFuse 1.8 feature of running high availability Node-RED applications. Marian Demme, FlowFuse Product Manager, will lead this session and share practical insights and best practices to show how FlowFuse can unlock the true potential of Node-RED in large-scale deployments. 

[Sign-up today](/webinars/2023/building-scalable-ha-node-red/) to join us on June 22. 

### Build an Edge-to-Cloud Solution with the MING Stack

On June 27, FlowFuse is doing a webinar with our friends at InfluxDB. A great opportunity to see how easy it is to use Node-RED and InfluxDB to send data from the edge to the cloud.  [Sign-up today](https://www.influxdata.com/resources/build-an-edge-to-cloud-solution-with-the-ming-stack/?utm_source=partner&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=2023-06-27_Webinar_FlowFuse-NodeRED&utm_term=speaker).

## From the Community

Gerrit Riessen has published a list of [Pros and Cons for using Node-RED](https://gorenje.medium.com/fourteen-for-fourteen-against-why-i-love-hate-and-connect-with-node-23797f9466ec). It is a pretty comprehensive list so check it out. FlowFuse is working to address some of the cons in Gerrit's list, specifically software delivery pipelines and the ability to deploy out to many end points.
