For the past several years, the Node-RED Dashboard has been an indispensable tool for many Node-RED users. It has offered a seamless way to create live dashboards, enabling the quick and intuitive creation of user interfaces for Node-RED flows. However, as the saying goes, "all good things must come to an end."

We at FlowFuse have identified a significant need for a modern, interactive data visualization and dashboard solution. Having evaluated a wide range of options, we've decided to embark on an exciting journey: the creation of what we hope becomes the official successor to the Node-RED Dashboard.

## The Problem at Hand

The original Node-RED Dashboard is based on Angular v1, which is no longer maintained. Although small patches have been and will continue to be applied on a "best can do" basis, there will be no major feature upgrades. The lack of ongoing maintenance and updates has the potential to lead to underlying security breakages, a risk we are not comfortable taking. We have recognized the need to innovate and adapt, which is why we are creating a completely new project to replace the existing Node-RED Dashboard.

## The Solution

The successor to the Node-RED Dashboard will be a completely new project, published as a separate package. This new project will take the reins from the old dashboard and guide us into the future with the support and blessing of the existing dashboard maintainers. The Node-RED community can rest assured that the project will stay under the Apache 2.0 licence and keep intact the core principles of open-source and community-driven development.

## Community Involvement and Open Source Contribution

We believe in the power of the community, and we want your feedback. If there are features you'd like to see or improvements you think can be made, we invite you to open a [Github issue](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowforge-nr-dashboard/issues/new/choose). Your insights and suggestions will be invaluable in shaping the future of this project. Contributions from the community are not just welcome, but highly encouraged. We believe that the strength of a project is proportional to the strength of its community.

In our commitment to transparency and collaboration, we will be documenting all major decision-making processes and sharing the details here in our blog as they become available. By working closely with additional Node-RED key figures like Dave Conway-Jones, and by making our development process as open and collaborative as possible, we aim to ensure that the successor to the Node-RED Dashboard lives up to the high standards set by the original, while also introducing innovative features and enhancements.

## Join the Team

Are you a developer looking for a new challenge? We are searching for a freelancer to help us with the development of the first version of the new dashboard. This is a 2-3 month project that provides an exciting opportunity to contribute to the future of data visualization and Node-RED. If you're interested, [we'd love to hear from you.](https://boards.greenhouse.io/flowfuse/jobs/4911532004)

## Charting the Course

As we embark on this new journey, we are excited about the potential of the successor to the Node-RED Dashboard. The road ahead will be filled with challenges, but we are confident that with the help of the community, and a dedicated team, we will create a tool that surpasses its predecessor in every way.

Join us on this exciting journey as we innovate, create, and redefine the future of data visualization with the successor to the Node-RED Dashboard.
