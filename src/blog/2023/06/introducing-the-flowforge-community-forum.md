We are thrilled to announce the launch of the [Community Forum for FlowFuse](https://community.flowforge.com).
A forum dedicated to empowering developers and enthusiasts to create innovative
applications using FlowFuse, Node-RED and related technologies.

Our community faces a new set of challenges, for example how to configure FlowFuse templates as administrator, or integration of the FlowFuse platform into another existing environment. These questions do not fit on the Node-RED discourse which is why FlowFuse now sports our own Community Forum. Furthermore, it’s the intent to keep the Node-RED forums vendor agnostic by the OpenJS foundation. Given FlowFuse is a vendor, it’s a fine balance to find. We hope and intend to be additive to the Node-RED community at large.

At FlowFuse, our vision is to create a thriving community of Node-RED and MQTT enthusiasts who are passionate about building real-world solutions. We believe in the power of collaboration, knowledge sharing, and problem-solving. With this in mind, FlowFuse aims to foster a positive and inclusive environment where members can engage in discussions, exchange ideas, and support one another.

Initially the forum is used to allow for discussions under each blog post on the FlowFuse blog, as well as a venue to provide community support. We also welcome discussions on the roadmap and backlog of FlowFuse. We have hopes that this community thrives and provides guidance, inspiration and opportunity to learn.
