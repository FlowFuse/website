FlowFuse 1.8 introduces two key features that allow organizations to reliably deploy Node-RED applications into production. In 1.8, it is now possible to run Node-RED applications with high availability so the application is more scalable and more fault tolerant. FlowFuse 1.8 also introduces software deliver pipelines, so development teams can now set up dev/test/production environments for their Node-RED applications.

## More reliable and scalable Node-RED applications
FlowFuse now makes it possible to deploy business critical applications built in Node-RED that are reliable and scalable. The new 1.8 features allows a Node-RED instance to be deployed in high availability mode, meaning two instances of the same Node-RED flows are available behind a load balancer. This allows for increased traffic to be automatically distributed across the two Node-RED instances. This means your Node-RED applications can handle more traffic and experience less downtime. For more details, please see our [documentation](/docs/user/high-availability).

Additionally, we're pleased to offer a 30-day premium trial license for self-managed installs on Kubernetes. To avail of this offer, book a demo at [flowforge.com/book-demo](/book-demo).

High Availability is our first [preview feature](/handbook/product/versioning/#preview-features), and your feedback is crucial. We encourage you to try out HA in your Node-RED instances and share your experiences with us. Your feedback will help us refine this feature and make it even better.

## DevOps Pipelines

FlowFuse 1.8 introduces the concept of Pipelines to better organize your Node-RED development. Development team can now set up different staging environments for different steps in the development cycle, ex. test, development and production. Node-RED instances can be pushed along a pipeline as they move along the development process. This allows for a better organized and predictable development process for your team. 

The new Pipelines feature builds upon the Staged Development support that we introduced in[FlowFuse Version 1.4](../../02/flowforge-1-4-0-released). We highly recommend that development teams avoid developing their flows directly in production instances. This approach fosters a more reliable and robust development process, reducing the risks associated with production environment modifications. Instead, start your development in a dedicated development or test instance and then deploy your Node-RED instance to production once they have been thoroughly tested and reviewed.

## User interface for Device Agent

In our previous release, we introduced [Editor Access for Devices](../../05/flowforge-1-7-released). Now, the FlowFuse Device Agent now comes with its very own User Interface (UI) for configuration.

Imagine this: Your industrial equipment arrives with the Device Agent preinstalled. In the past, you might have faced challenges in configuring and connecting your device with FlowFuse, particularly if you had no direct shell access. But not any more.

With the newly introduced UI, you can easily set up and connect your device with FlowFuse without needing to access the command line interface directly. This simplifies the process significantly and saves you time. For more details, see our [documentation](/docs/user/devices/).

## Node-RED 3.1 Beta 3 Available

FlowFuse Cloud is a great place to try out the new Node-RED features, with FlowFuse Cloud now including the [Node-RED 3.1.0-beta.3](https://discourse.nodered.org/t/node-red-3-1-0-beta-3-released/78716). If you want to try this version you can [duplicate your instance](/docs/user/instance-settings/) and [upgrade your stack](/docs/user/changestack/).
