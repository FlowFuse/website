FlowFuse is used by businesses and hobbyists alike. We aim to provide a platform that meets the needs of both, recognizing the importance of hobbyists in the Node-RED community and the long term success of FlowFuse as a company. We want to make it as easy as possible for people to get started on FlowFuse Cloud and help them understand the full value the platform offers. One of the barriers we've seen has been the current pricing structure of FlowFuse Cloud.

<!--more-->

Since FlowFuse Cloud was introduced there’s been essentially one tier for everyone to adopt. Customers were charged $15 per month for each Node-RED instance managed by the FlowFuse platform, whether running in the cloud or on their own hardware using our Device Agent.

Today we’re introducing different tiers: Starter and Pro. The Starter tier gives you access to 2 FlowFuse managed Node-RED instances, 2 Node-RED devices, with up to 2 team members - all for a flat rate of $15 per month.

The new Pro tier unlocks more value to adopt FlowFuse in a professional environment and grow beyond the Starter tier. It’s well suited for teams up to 20 members, and includes increased limits for file storage and persistent context. It also unlocks some key features such as the shared Team Library and Project Nodes, used to seamlessly transport data between instances. Pricing starts at $25 per managed Node-RED instance and $15 per device.

We will soon be launching our third tier, more targeted at Enterprise users. This tier enhances the compliance capabilities through Single-Sign on (SSO), and provides higher SLA’s for both support and high availability for running Node-RED at scale.

We expect these layers to fit the customers as they grow in their FlowFuse and Node-RED adoption journey.
