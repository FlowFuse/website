## New Release

Last week we released FlowForge 1.10, featuring improvements to our device management solutions and the new ability to import environment variable templates. Read about the details of FlowForge 1.10 in our [release announcement](https://flowforge.com/blog/2023/08/flowforge-1-10-release/). 

## Upcoming events

### Getting Started with OPC-UA and Node-RED

OPC-UA is a popular communication protocol used to communicate industrial data between different types of hardware and software. Our next webinar show how to use Node-RED to create an OPC-UA client that can read OPC data and visualize the data in Node-RED. We are glad to welcome Mika Karaila, Research Director @ Valmet Automation and creator of the OPC-UA nodes, as our webinar speaker. 

[Sign-up today](https://flowforge.com/webinars/2023/getting-started-opcua-node-red/) to join us on July 27.
