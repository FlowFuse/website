FlowFuse 1.10 release includes improvements to device management and importing environment variable templates.

<!--more-->
## Import Environment Variable Templates  [#2372](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/2372)

FlowFuse 1.10 now allows users to import environment variable templates. This makes it much easier and less error prone to maintain and add new environment variables to Node-RED instances running on FlowFuse. 


## DevOps Pipelines now can include devices [#2243](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/2243)
DevOps pipelines have proven very popular for creating dev/test/production environments for Node-Red flow development. Now, devices can be associated with a pipeline so when a snapshot is created it can be pushed to all the devices associated with the pipeline.  This will improve the overall quality and reliability of Node-RED development for remote devices.

## Devices can now access the team library [#2294](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/2294)

Team libraries allow Node-RED development team to share common flows and nodes through a shared library. Until the 1.10 release, Node-RED running remotely on a device did not have access to the team library. This limitation is now removed so device development can benefit from reusing standard flows.

## Other New Features

- Add description of device type field  [#2428](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/2428)
- Improve reliability of device editor [#2483](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/2483)
- Improve error feedback from device editor tunnel [#2473](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/2473)


## Bug Fixes

- Improve visualization of Last Seen & Last Known with large amounts of devices. [#2380](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/2380)
- Fix billing information error in FlowFuse Cloud [#2416](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/2416)
- Fix T&C checkbox on sign-up page [#2419](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/2419)
