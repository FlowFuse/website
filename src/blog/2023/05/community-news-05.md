## Upcoming events

### Ask Me Anything about Debugging Node-RED
Our monthly Node-RED AMA session will have a special focus on debugging. Nick and Rob will lead us through some useful debug workflows to show how they approach debugging Node-RED applications. During the live coding sessions there will be opportunities for attendees to ask questions in real-time. Join us to learn from the experts on the tips and tricks for debugging Node-RED flows. [Sign-up today to participate](https://flowforge.com/ask-me-anything/ama-nodered-may/). 

### Getting Started with Node-RED Dashboard
How can you use Node-RED to create dashboards and interactive graphs of your data? The answer is the Node-RED Dashboard node, the most popular node in the Node-RED community. In this webinar, Rob Marcer will take you through the steps of how to get started with the Node-RED Dashboard.

## From the Community

Jsonata is a very useful and often underutilised tool built into Node-RED. Steve over at [Steve's Node-RED Guide](https://stevesnoderedguide.com) has published a great beginners guide. If you are new to Jsonata and want to learn more we recommend you [take a look](https://stevesnoderedguide.com/node-red-and-jsonata-for-beginners).

### Custom Node Spotlight - node-red-contrib-queue-gate

[Queue Gate](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-queue-gate) is a handy custom node which allows you to control the flow of messages. You might wish to queue up all the messages in a flow and then release them all, once an hour. Maybe you want to release just one message at a time and wait until the prior message completed a section of your flow. Queue Gate makes message queuing really easy without the need to use an external queue solution.
