Welcome to the FlowForge newsletter for December 2022, a monthly roundup of what’s been happening with both FlowForge and the wider Node-RED community.

[**Node-RED Nears 3.1 Release**](https://github.com/node-red/node-red/milestone/19)
As we mentioned last month, the release of Node-RED 3.1 is expected very soon. 3.1 includes lots of great new features such as support for [locking flows in the editor](https://github.com/node-red/node-red/pull/3938) and [improving the user experience around hiding flows](https://github.com/node-red/node-red/pull/3930). As an open source project the development of Node-RED is entirely dependent on individuals and companies giving their time to work towards each new release. If you'd like to know how you can get involved you can read more on the [Node-RED web site](https://nodered.org/about/contribute/).

[**FlowForge 1.2 Released**](http://localhost:8080/blog/2022/12/flowforge-1-2-0-released/)   
Version 1.2 of FlowForge was released on 23rd December. Our last release of the year included some great new features such as [Sign Sign-On](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/226) to make it easier for your team to access your projects and [Persistent Context](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/212) which allows you to retain context values even when restarting projects. We're now working towards our first release of 2023 which is due on 19th January. You can see what we are planning to deliver in that release and beyond on [FlowForge's project board](https://github.com/orgs/flowforge/projects/5). 

If you’d like to learn more about what else was included in 1.2 you can do so on our [blog post](http://flowforge.com/blog/2022/12/flowforge-1-2-0-released/), [GitHub release page](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/releases/tag/v1.2.0), and [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7TjqUAub1g).

[**5 IoT Sensor Technologies to Watch**](https://iot-analytics.com/5-iot-sensor-technologies/)  
The rise of the Internet of Things in recent years has gone hand-in-hand with the rise of sensors. On average, four new sensors are connected with every new IoT device that comes online. With approximately 14 billion current IoT connections, this means more than 50 billion connected sensors have been deployed. IoT sensor technology plays a crucial role in the IoT tech stack because these sensors collect data from the physical world and convert it into digital signals.

**Custom Node Spotlight - node-red-contrib-string** 
String manipulation comes up in so many programming scenarios. Node-RED has a lot of tools to help you edit your strings including support for [JSONata](https://jsonata.org/) and using the trusty function node but for those of us who prefer to keep things 'no-code' [node-red-contrib-string](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-string) allows you to stack string manipulations together quickly and easily. It has a huge library of ready to use functions.

[**FlowForge Team News**](https://flowforge.com/team/)    
We’d like to welcome two new members to the FlowForge team. [Ian Skerrett](https://twitter.com/ianskerrett) has joined as our Head of Marketing and Tracy has joined as our HR Manager.
