Share your flows via team libraries, control access to your Node-RED dashboards using FlowForge credentials, and filter your audit logs by users and actions.

<!--more-->

We're pleased to announce version 1.3 is now available! Due to the recent holiday season, most of our team have been away from their desks but we still have some great new features to share. Keep reading for the details of what's in this release or you can watch our 1 minute roundup video of the new release above.

To make it easy for everyone to experience FlowForge, we are introducing a new [free 30-day trial](https://app.flowforge.com/account/create). With this trial, you can experience the power of using FlowForge to quickly deliver Node-RED applications in a reliable, repeatable, collaborative, and secure manner. To get your trial simply [sign up for a new FlowForge team](https://app.flowforge.com/account/create).

## Features

[Share your flows via team libraries](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/237) \
FlowForge has now added the ability for you to share your flows via the import and export features in Node-RED. Once you export a flow everyone else in your FlowForge team will be able to import your work into their projects. You can see a demonstration of this new feature in [the video](https://youtu.be/B7XK3TUklUU) below.

[Control access to your Node-RED dashboards using FlowForge credentials](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/1325) \
In FlowForge 0.10 we added the ability to secure endpoints created within your FlowForge projects. This allows you to create dashboards or APIs and limit who can access them. In 1.3 we've added the ability for you to limit access to those same resources based on the visitor having a user account on your FlowForge team. You can see a demonstration of this new feature in [the video](https://youtu.be/JRk-Cf7eNIo) below.

[Filter your audit logs for easier reading](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/1448) \
In FlowForge 1.3 weâ€™ve added the ability to filter your admin logs by user or action type. We think this is a great new feature which will help admins have confidence that they will be able to review the audit logs quickly when needed. You can see a demonstration of this new feature in [the video](https://youtu.be/p0Vuy5x42Go) below.

## Improvements

With FlowForge v1.4 some changes were made under the hood to speed up the recovery
of Node-RED instances. On terminal failures of an instance it will now be
automatically be redeployed with the correct flows. This uses Kubernetes features
and is also available if you've installed through [kubernetes](https://flowforge.com/docs/install/kubernetes/).
To migrate the old style of deployments to this system a restart or stack upgrade is needed.
