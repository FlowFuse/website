## New User Features


**Automatic Device Provisioning**

Most prominently, FlowFuse 1.4 features automatic device onboarding for fleets. Simply download a FlowFuse device provisioning credential to allow quick roll-out to a whole fleet, without the need to have device specific configuration. When the agent starts, the FlowFuse agent and the Node-RED snapshot will automatically be provisioned to the device and start operations. [Issue #1212](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues/1212)

**Support for Staged Development**

A new feature of 1.4 is the ability to setup staged deployments. This makes it possible to simply move a project between a Development > Test > Production for your Node-RED application delivery. [Issue #1580](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues/1580)

## Improvements

- It's now much easier to change the resources available to your Node-RED instance. With a few clicks a resource intensive workload can be processed faster by changing between small, medium, or large instance types. [#595](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues/595)

- Last release allows users to capture flows in a shared library to reuse in another flow, now it's possible to preview the stored flows. [#1657](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues/1657)

- Add a synchronous mode for the FlowFuse persisted context store, next to the asynchronous mode already available. [#17](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowforge-nr-persistent-context/issues/17)

- Add a Last Seen status for devices connecting to FlowFuse. [#1599](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues/1599)

- Added a check to ensure the team slug is unique. [#1609](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues/1609)

- Optionally set snapshot as target at creation, to quickly roll out changes to remote deployments [#1527](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues/1527)
- Agents are more rugged when starting up if they're unable to connect to FlowFuse, and will retry to connect.

- With FlowFuse v1.4 some changes were made under the hood to speed up the recovery
of Node-RED instances. On terminal failures of an instance it will now be
automatically be redeployed with the correct flows. This uses Kubernetes features
and is also available if you've installed through [kubernetes](/docs/install/kubernetes/).
To migrate the old style of deployments to this system a restart or stack upgrade is needed.

## Bug Fixes

We've fixed the following bugs in this release.
- Deleting your only team, doesn't exit from the team UI. [#1630](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues/1630)
- Async Team Slug Check. [#1609](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues/1609)
- Improve communication of Device Last Seen and Status [#1599](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues/1599)
