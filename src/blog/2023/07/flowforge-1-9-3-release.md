FlowFuse and the Device Agent both received updates yesterday that bring improvements to the Device Agent editor experience, making it more resilient to network issues.

## Improving the Device Agent editor experience

The ability to remotely edit flows running the Device Agent has been warmly welcomed by many users on the platform. Along with that comes great feedback we can use to continue improving the user experience.

Some early feedback identified issues with the resilience of the tunnel we connect between the Device Agent and the platform. If the tunnel was interrupted for any reason, the user would have to manually set it up again.

With the FlowFuse 1.9.3 release, now running FlowFuse Cloud, along with the latest version of the Device Agent, we have made the tunnel much more resilient. It can now restablish itself without any intervention from the user - making for a much more seamless experience.
