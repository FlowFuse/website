FlowFuse 1.9 adds new features to make it easier to administer FlowFuse platform deployments, including new API documentation and the ability to create customized Node-RED palettes.

<!--more-->

## API Documentation
FlowFuse API allows developers to programmatically interact with the FlowFuse platform. This makes it possible to integrate FlowFuse into different infrastructure technologies, create scripts to automate specific FlowFuse tasks and embed FlowFuse into other applications.

In the 1.9 release we are now publishing our [API documentation](/docs/api/) using the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) and making it viewable with the Swagger UI. Both these industrial standards will make using the FlowFuse API easier to use and understand.


## Customize Node-RED Palettes  [#2002](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues/2002)

FlowFuse platform adminstrators are now able to create customized Node-RED palettes that will be used when a Node-RED instance is created. An adminstator can create pre-defined templates to specify the nodes that should be included in the palette. This makes it easier for FlowFuse teams to standardized on Node-RED usage across an organization.

Note: this feature is not available for FlowFuse cloud users since they do not have administrator access.


## New RBAC Role for Dashboard users [#2292](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues/1924)
A new FlowFuse user role has been created to view Node-RED dashboards. This allows for users to view Nod-RED dashboards without access to the Node-RED editor or requiring separate login credentials.
