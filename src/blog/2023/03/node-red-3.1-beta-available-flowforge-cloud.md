We are excited to announce that Node-RED 3.1 Beta 2 is now available on
FlowForge Cloud! By making this version available as beta release we hope users
validate the beta release and provide feedback on the release before the beta
badge is dropped.

To help our users test their flows in this new version, FlowForge allows you to
copy an application through the "Duplicate Project" button in the settings. By
clicking this button the version of Node-RED can be changed to the Beta release.
We'd appreciate any feedback on the new Node-RED version, especially if there's
backward incompatible changes. This way we can improve the release before the
new version of Node-RED is deployed to production.

While testing if your flows work as expected, you might enjoy using the improved
editor context menu through right-clicking on the workspace, try out the flow
locking, or add images to flow descriptions.


We encourage all our users to take advantage of this opportunity to test their
flows in Node-RED 3.1. This will not only help them identify any potential
issues but also allow them to try out the new features and improvements in this
version. We believe that this new version of Node-RED will make it even easier
for our users to create powerful applications and automate their workflows.
