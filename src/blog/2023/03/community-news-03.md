## From the Community

### Node-RED Community Survey
The Node-RED open source project is running an Node-RED Community Survey. Give your [feedback on how you are using Node-RED](https://nodered.org/blog/2023/02/23/community-survey).

### Good alternatives to Pis for your next project
Raspberry Pis continue to be difficult to purchase, Eben Upton of the Raspberry Pi Foundation has said that supply should improve this year but in the mean-time there are some good alternatives to Pis you could consider. The youtube channel ExplainingComputers has shared a great video covering some of the most popular SBCs you could use for your next project, it’s worth a watch.

### Custom Node Spotlight - node-red-contrib-os

OS is a great custom node which allows you to monitor the performance of the device you are running Node-RED on. It can check RAM usage, disk space, CPU load, and a lot more. It’s really easy to use, we recommend you take a look.
