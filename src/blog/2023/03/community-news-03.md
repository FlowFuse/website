## From the Community

### Node-RED Community Survey
The Node-RED open source project is running an Node-RED Community Survey. Give your [feedback on how you are using Node-RED](https://nodered.org/blog/2023/02/23/community-survey).

### Good alternatives to Pis for your next project
Raspberry Pis continue to be difficult to purchase. Eben Upton of the Raspberry Pi Foundation has said that [supply should improve this year](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/supply-chain-update-its-good-news/) but in the mean-time there are some good alternatives you could consider. The Youtube channel [ExplainingComputers](https://www.youtube.com/@ExplainingComputers) has shared a [great video covering some of the most popular SBCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8clrUclPIs) you could use for your next project, it’s worth a watch.

### Custom Node Spotlight - node-red-contrib-os
[OS](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-os) is a great custom node which allows you to monitor the performance of the device you are running Node-RED on. It can check RAM usage, disk space, CPU load, and a lot more. It’s really easy to use, we recommend you [take a look](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-os).
