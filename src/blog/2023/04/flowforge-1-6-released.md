The new FlowFuse 1.6 adds new support for multi-instance Node-RED within a single application and support for logging from remote devices.

## FlowFuse Applications Can Now Support Multi-Instance Node-RED

FlowFuse 1.6 expands the scope of applications to now allow for multiple instances of Node-RED. For complex Node-RED applications, it is common to have different flows interacting with other flows or flows deployed to different target environments. The ability to associate all these different flows with a single application makes it easier for the development, test and deployment of these types of complex applications.

## Access Node-RED logs from remote devices

FlowFuse makes it easy to deploy Node-RED out to remote devices. However, once Node-RED has been deployed to the remote device it is often difficult to troubleshoot or debug. Now with FlowFuse 1.6, you can get access to the Node-RED logs from remote devices. This makes it much easier to understand and debug the behavior of a remote device.
