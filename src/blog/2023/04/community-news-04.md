## From the Community

### Quantum for Node-RED
Discover how you can incorporate [quantum technologies](https://theailaboratory.wordpress.com/2023/03/24/quantum-for-everyone/) into your Node-RED flows.  

### Image recognition within Node-RED
Kazuhito Yokoi, a researcher at Hitachi, has published an [interesting article](https://kazuhitoyokoi.medium.com/sharing-node-red-flow-of-image-recognition-application-on-github-4d667cdea9f7) detailing how to incorporate TensorFlow into a Node-RED application to do image recognition.

### Custom Node Spotlight - node-red-contrib-web-worldmap
If you would like to include a map in your next project Worldmap is a really good place to start. You can pass coordinates in to set the map to a location or you can use the built in search tool to find a location. As a user manipulates the map a stream of updated coordinates can be passed back to your flows to trigger additional actions. It's a really useful tool, take a [look here](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-web-worldmap).
