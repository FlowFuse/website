"Do you use Node-RED?" This simple question became our favorite conversation opener as ZJ and I attended Hannover Messe, the world's leading industrial trade fair.

To our delight, the answer was almost always "Yes." This allowed us to dive into truly fruitful discussions with Node-RED experts, exploring the latest industry trends, connecting with potential partners, and sharing our vision for the future of Node-RED in the manufacturing sector. During our visit, we had the pleasure of engaging with several vendors, including Bosch Rexroth, Siemens, Wago, Weidm√ºller, RevolutionPi, and more. It was genuinely inspiring to see the widespread adoption and usage of Node-RED across the entire industry. See also our [arcticle](https://flowforge.com/blog/2023/03/integration-platform-for-edge-computing/#the-standard-for-edge-computing-and-plcs) about the adoption of Node-RED for PLCs and Gateways.

FlowForge's innovative solutions, such as remote deployment of Node-RED instances, seamless updates, effortless rollbacks, and built-in security, are already addressing many challenges faced by Node-RED users in the industry today. The positive feedback we received at Hannover Messe has bolstered our commitment to making Node-RED more accessible and production-ready for industrial and enterprise scenarios. As we forge ahead, we are eager to collaborate with more partners, learn from industry leaders, and remain at the forefront of Node-RED development. Together, we can build a more connected, efficient, and innovative manufacturing industry. With each new booth we visited and every conversation we had, it became increasingly clear that Node-RED and FlowForge are well on their way to becoming an integral part of the industrial landscape.
