It is often a challenge to measure the health of an open source project, like Node-RED. Individuals can download and use Node-RED without any indication or feedback to their ongoing satisfaction or usage. However, it is still interesting to look at a variety of metrics to understand the size and health of the Node-RED community.

**GitHub Stars**

A popular method for demonstrating popularity of an open source project are GitHub stars. Node-RED has over 16K stars and when [compared to other low-code platforms](https://synodus.com/blog/low-code/open-source-low-code-platforms/) on GitHub has a strong showing. FWIW, GitHub stars are open to gaming so it is not a great long-term indicator of community health and engagement.

**Node-RED Library**

At the core of the Node-RED community is the library of nodes and flows that have been developed by community members. The current library has over [4300 nodes available](https://flows.nodered.org/search?type=node&sort=downloads), some of the more popular nodes are downloaded more than 10K times per week. The large library of community nodes supports a wide range of protocols, data sources, data stores, and much more. This makes Node-RED more relevant and useful to many more potential users. 

**Node-RED Website Traffic** 

In the last year, Node-RED has had over 1.9 million unique visitors to the [nodered.org](https://nodered.org/) website, over 160K on a monthly basis. The most popular pages, after the home page, are the getting started pages. This demonstrates a strong interest in learning more about how to use Node-RED. 

**NPM Downloads & Docker Pull Requests**

Node-RED is installed by lots of people using Docker and NPM. The project averages over 500K/month pull request from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nodered/node-red) and 100K/month pull request on [NPM](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=node-red&from=2017-03-22&to=2023-03-22). 

**Node-RED Forums**

The [Node-RED community forum](https://discourse.nodered.org/) is the go to place to get community support. It is a very popular community with over 900K page views per month. The amazing thing is that a very large percentage of questions receive replies from other community members. A great sign of a healthy community.

Overall, the Node-RED community is large, healthy and engaged.
