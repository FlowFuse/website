For an open core company, we haven't been very open with what we're doing. That all
changes today with the release of FlowForge 0.1 and making all of our repositories
public.

This is a significant step for the company as we look to build a platform around Node-RED.

<!--more-->

The main question we get asked is: 'What is FlowForge?" - which is a very reasonable
question to ask.

FlowForge is a platform for managing Node-RED instances at scale. It lets you have
multiple users on the platform, organised into teams to provide proper access control
to individual Node-RED instances, or Projects as we call them.

With the 0.1 release, we have the basic building blocks of the platform in place.

 - Add multiple users to the platform
 - Create teams for those users
 - Create Node-RED projects quickly and easily through the platform UI

For a more complete walk-through of the platform in this early release, you can
watch this video.

### Getting started with FlowForge

The documentation provides a guide for [installing FlowForge on a local server](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/tree/main/docs).

We also have drivers for deploying to Docker Compose and Kubernetes based environments
to enable a larger scale of deployment. We'll have more documentation on those options
in the near future.

### Getting help

If you hit any problems with the platform, or have questions to ask, please do
raise an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues).

That also includes if you have any feedback or feature requests.

### What's next?

With so much in the plan and lots of exciting features to come, we will have a
regular cycle of releases every four weeks. So you can expect the next release, 0.2,
on Thursday 17th February.

As we're only at 0.1 today, there is a lot still to do. We will be following the
principles of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with our releases,
but until we reach 1.0, there may be disruptive changes between releases.

doing.
