One of the things I'm most looking forward to with starting FlowForge is building
the team who are going to help create something special and have fun whilst doing it.
With Ben having joined last week, this week I get to share the news that Sam Machin ([@sammachin](https://twitter.com/sammachin)) is joining the team as a Senior Developer Advocate.

Sam is a seasoned Developer Advocate, who really understands the difference
between evangelism and advocacy. He is acutely aware of the differences between
developers as customers and as partners in an ecosystem.

The Node-RED community is so important to us - we simply wouldn't be doing what
we do today without their support. As we continue to drive the project forward,
and build the FlowForge platform around it, we have to keep developers are the heart
of what we do.

Keeping that 2-way conversation open is not an easy task, but Sam's in a great
position to help us do just that.

Sam is an experienced Product Manager and will be able to give the community a seat at the table when it comes to shaping our plans. The Node-RED community is an integral part of what will make FlowForge a success and his first responsibility is to ensure that.

Welcome aboard Sam!
