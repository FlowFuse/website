We're continuing to grow the FlowFuse team with our latest hire; Steve McLaughlin
who is joining our development team.

<!--more-->

Steve is a well known face in the Node-RED community. He is a regular contributor
to the community forum, always happy to help users with their questions.

He has published a number of very popular nodes, include [buffer-parser](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-buffer-parser),
[cron-plus](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-cron-plus) and
[image-tools](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-image-tools).

He has also made some significant contributions to the core of Node-RED, such as
delivering MQTTv5 support and introducing the Monaco code editor into the heart
of the editor.

Steve joins us from a background in Industrial IoT in the automative manufacturing
space - experience and knowledge that will be invaluable as we look to growing the
FlowFuse platform.

Steve will be focussed on the Node-RED side of our activities - helping to continue
the ongoing development and growth of the open source project at the heart of what
FlowFuse is about.

Welcome aboard Steve!
