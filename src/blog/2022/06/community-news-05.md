[FlowFuse 0.5 AND 0.6](/blog/2022/06/flowforge-06-released/)  
We've had two releases since our last newsletter, there are a lot of related features between them. 
We introduced a new design for the forge application which aligns with the branding on our website.
We've added [Devices](/docs/user/concepts/#device), allowing you to run and manage your Node-RED projects on your own hardware, this is ideal for applications that need to connect to either sensor data or specialist hardware deployed outside the cloud.
We added a new concept as part of this work, [Snapshots](/docs/user/concepts/#instance-snapshot) allow you to take a point in time copy of your project, today that can then be deployed to one or more devices but we have plans to expand this concept for things like [rolling back](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues/587) a project to a previous point in time.
[0.5](/blog/2022/05/flowforge-05-released/) Introduced the capabilities of copying a project or certain parts of it, allowing for scenarios like having multiple environments for Development and Production.

[Node-RED 3.0.0-beta-3](https://discourse.nodered.org/t/node-red-3-0-0-beta-3-released/64027)  
The Node-RED 3.0 beta releases continue as the project is getting very close to the full release in the coming weeks, We'll be making it availble on FlowFuse cloud very soon.

One of the contributors to Node-RED, Kazuhito Yokoi wrote a nice tutorial on how to turn a subflow into a custom node.
