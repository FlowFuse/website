as a Software Developer

Sean is a seasoned developer heavily experienced in the industrial automation and
process controls. The "PLC Mercenary" as he is known, has been a FOSS advocate, and 
champion of vendor agnostic control systems. Sean became a Node-RED fanatic after
using the platform for critical system monitoring of Oil and Gas production sites. 

For several years he has pioneered cloud deployed Supervisory Control Data 
Acquisition System (SCADA) projects tightly integrated with Node-RED. Sean brings
experience in automating cloud deployment, and production container systems for critical
safety and environmental protection. Invaluable insight for customers as we grow
FlowForge into the digital distruptor industry needs.

Welcome aboard Sean!
