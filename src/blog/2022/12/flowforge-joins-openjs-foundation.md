We're pleased to share the news we've joined the OpenJS Foundation to bolster our
support for the Node-RED community.

<!--more-->

One of our [founding principles](https://flowforge.com/handbook/company/#open-source-stewardship) is
the importance of Open Source being at the core of what we do.

Node-RED has been part of the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/) since it was formed in 2019.
The Foundation provides the project a vendor-neutral home and enables its open governance model that
allows anyone to get involved.

It also provides some vitally important resources to the community, such as the hosting for the
[community forum](https://discourse.nodered.org), which regularly gets over 1.5 Million page views a
month.

With my Node-RED Project Lead hat on, I regularly see the impact the foundation has had on the growth
of the Node-RED community. These are things that may not always be obvious to our end users, but
we wouldn't be where we are today with them.

The success of what we're building with FlowFuse relies on a strong and healthy Node-RED community.
Becoming members of the Foundation allows us to provide more yet more support to Node-RED and the wider
JavaScript communities represented by the foundation.
