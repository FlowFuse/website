[**FlowForge 1.1 Released**](http://flowforge.com/blog/2022/10/flowforge-1-1-released/)   
Version 1.1 was released on 24th November. Our latest release represents our vision of the base set of features needed for you to get great value from using FlowForge in a production environment. That's not to say we are done, we will continue to add features, improve our interfaces and fix bugs with the same enthusiasm as we've worked towards 1.0. We'd like to hear your feedback on what we will be including in [1.1 and beyond](https://github.com/orgs/flowforge/projects/5). 

If you’d like to learn more about what else was included in 1.1 you can do so on our [blog post](http://flowforge.com/blog/2022/10/flowforge-1-1-released), on our [GitHub release page](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/releases/tag/v1.1.0) and on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=134iljE_urI). We’d also love for more of you to get involved in the development of FlowForge, [contributions to the code](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [bug reports](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues) are really appreciated.

[**Node-RED Nears 3.1 Release**](https://github.com/node-red/node-red/milestone/19)
As we mentioned last month, the release of Node-RED 3.1 is expected very soon. 3.1 includes lots of great new features such as support for [locking flows in the editor](https://github.com/node-red/node-red/pull/3938) and [improving the user experience around hiding flows](https://github.com/node-red/node-red/pull/3930). As an open source project the development of Node-RED is entirely dependent on individuals and companies giving their time to work towards each new releases. If you'd like to know how you can get involved you can read more on the [Node-RED web site](https://nodered.org/about/contribute/).
    
**FlowForge annual team meetup** 
FlowForge is an fully remote team, we currently have a strong skew towards western Europe we are in the process of ticking off team members in each of the continents. On that point, any great Product Managers who live in Antarctica are encouraged to [apply for a job with us](https://boards.greenhouse.io/flowforge/jobs/4717778004)! Remote work is great but it's also valuable to get everyone together in the real world. FlowForge had such a meet up in November in Winchester on the south coast of the UK. We came from near and far and took the opportunity to have productive round-table discussions about some features we are working towards in 1.2 and beyond.  We also dropped into [Clue Capers](https://cluecapers.co.uk/), a great Escape Room in the center of Winchester who provided the photo below to mark the occasion.

[**Node-Redscape - 100% Free, Open-Source Escape Room Control Software**](https://github.com/playfultechnology/node-redscape)  
As mentioned above, the FlowForge team went to an Escape Room in Winchester as part of our meet up. Co-incidentally, a great Node-RED project came up a few days after our visit which we thought was worth sharing. Node-Redscape. in their own words 'provides a set of templates, flows, and examples that turn Node-RED into a complete Escape Room automation system'. Very topical for us and also seems like a great project. You can learn more about the project on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yYDxqK_2E) as well as on [Github](https://github.com/playfultechnology/node-redscape).

[**FlowForge Team News**](https://flowforge.com/team/)
