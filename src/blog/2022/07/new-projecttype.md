We've added a second size of project to our offering on FlowForge Cloud
<!--more-->

Our [0.7 release](https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/07/flowforge-07-released/) introduced the concept of Project Types, this allows us to offer projects at different price points based on the stack they are using.
Today we've put this feature to work by introducing the medium sized project alongside the existing small size, you will be offered the choice of types when you create a new project.

Medium projects have 3 times the resources of the small allowing for more complex flows and larger message objects, this will be useful to business users looking to process complex sets of data.
Our Medium project is priced at $50 a month, we'll be adding additional new features to this project type in the coming months to further enhance the value of the higher tier.

Whilst upgrading the project type is not currently available we [plan](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/595) to add this capability in a future release, however if you do have a small project you want to move to medium today you can do this using the Export Project feature in the settings tab to crate a new project on the Medium type and then delete your old small project.
