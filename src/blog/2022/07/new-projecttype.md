We've added a second size of project to FlowForge Cloud. A bigger project type with more resources available to it.

Our [0.7 release](https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/07/flowforge-07-released/) introduced the concept of Project Types, this allows us to offer projects at different price points based on the stack they are using.
Today we've put this feature to work by introducing the medium sized project alongside the existing small size, you will be offered the choice of types when you create a new project.

Medium projects have 3 times the resources of the small allowing for more complex flows and larger message objects, this will be useful to business users looking to process complex sets of data.
Our Medium project is priced at $50 a month, we'll be adding additional new features to this project type in the coming months to further enhance the value of the higher tier.

We don't currently support directly upgrading a project between types, but that is in the [plan for the future](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/595). In the meantime, you can use the 'Export Project' feature on a project's settings tab to copy it over into a new Medium type project.
