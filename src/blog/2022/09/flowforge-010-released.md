Keep reading for the details of what's in this release or you can watch our 1 minute roundup video of the new release above. 

We're pleased to announce version 0.10 is now available. The next release of the FlowFuse application containing new features, a number of improvements, and bug fixes. Keep reading for a promotion code to get your first month free on FlowFuse Cloud. 

## Features
[Secure HTTP Endpoints](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/578)
We've added the ability for you to secure your HTTP endpoints. You can now control who can access Dashboards or API endpoints you create in FlowFuse.

[Read-only Users](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/657)
We've added a new user role for Read-only access. This will allow users to login to your FlowFuse project and view the Node-RED flows without them being able to edit anything.

[Static Outbound IP Addresses](/docs/cloud/#ip-addresses)
We've updated FlowFuse Cloud so that all outbound traffic from your projects now comes from a single IP address. When trying to access a remote resource such as a database it is often a requirement for the IP address the traffic comes from to be fixed. 

## Improvements
We've made a number of improvements to the overall experience of running FlowFuse.

- Allow both key and component in a ff-data-table column definition [#43](https://github.com/flowforge/forge-ui-components/issues/43)
- Default Stack and Templates [#989](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/989)
