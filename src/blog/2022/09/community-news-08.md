Welcome to the FlowFuse newsletter, a regular roundup of what’s happening with both FlowFuse and the wider Node-RED community.

[**FlowFuse 0.9**](/blog/2022/09/flowforge-09-released/)   
Version 0.9 was released on 1st September. Our latest release includes some great new features, quality of life improvements and bug fixes. Notable additions included the ability to [suspend your projects](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/pull/893), [login with your email](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/pull/856) and [define custom paths for your dashboards](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues/774).  

If you’d like to learn more about what else was included in 0.9 you can do so on our [blog post](/blog/2022/09/flowforge-09-released/), on our [GitHub release page](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/releases/tag/v0.9.0) and on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d23Pmyc0k7I). We’d also love for more of you to get involved in the development of FlowFuse, [contributions to the code](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [bug reports](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues) are really appreciated.
    
[**Node-RED Con 2022**](https://nrcon.nodered.org/)  
We are happy to again be involved in Node-RED con. The event is being held online on 7th October, with content for both English and Japanese speakers. You can find out more on the [Node-RED Con website](https://nrcon.nodered.org/).  

[**FlowFuse Team News**](/team/)    
We’d like to welcome Rob Marcer to the FlowFuse team. Rob has joined as our Developer Educator, he's going to work to help you get the best value from FlowFuse by developing our documentation and community support.  
  
We are also recruiting for [NodeJS Developers](https://boards.greenhouse.io/flowfuse/jobs/4463977004), if you’re interested in joining our team please [apply here](https://boards.greenhouse.io/flowfuse/jobs/4463977004#app).
    
[**Official Node-RED Docker Image Passes Milestone**](https://twitter.com/Docker/status/1559919666721693699?t=QBzGGzY2kJ12Z5aoi1QPTA)  
Docker has [announced](https://twitter.com/Docker/status/1559919666721693699?t=QBzGGzY2kJ12Z5aoi1QPTA) that the Node-RED Docker image has now been downloaded over 100 million times. They have also created a [guide to using Node-RED](https://www.docker.com/blog/build-retail-store-items-detection-system-no-code-ai/?utm_campaign=2022-08-17-brnd-nocode&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter) to Build and Deploy a Retail Store Items Detection System Using No-Code AI Vision at the Edge. We think it’s worth a read.
    
[**Simulating IOT Projects in Your Browser**](https://wokwi.com/)  
While not directly related to FlowFuse we’ve enjoyed wasting a little too much time looking at the simulated IOT projects on [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/). The [Simon Game with Score](https://wokwi.com/projects/328451800839488084) project is a little too addictive.
