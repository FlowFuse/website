A year ago our CTO, Nick O'Leary, [introduced FlowFuse](/blog/2021/04/first-deploy/).
Since then major milestones have been achieved. As we grow as a company, important
steps are taken. Today we make another very important step; we're accepting our
first customers.

A few weeks ago our product was nearly in a state where it could support customers,
when that was the case, we [opened up our waitlist](/blog/2022/02/announcing-flowforge-cloud/).
The waitlist has been growing daily and now we're ready to start inviting those
users onto the platform. The first
lucky few users are being added today, and each working day for the foreseeable
future we'll continue onboarding users. New users will receive an email from our
team with their login details and can start creating new workflows with Node-RED
minutes after.

While the source code of FlowFuse is [available](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse),
there's a chance you're unfamiliar with what has been built around Node-RED.
With FlowFuse, our intent is to build a platform to aid with colaboration of
flows in Node-RED. The first steps to our vision include a managed Node-RED 
instance to connect virtually any online service. Multiple users will have
access to the same flows and can collaborate. Further, once Node-RED 3.0 has
been released, the platform will provide a pain-free way to upgrade and keep
your projects up to date. There's many more exciting features right around the
corner on our [roadmap](/changelog/)
