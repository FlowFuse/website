A year ago our CTO, Nick O'Leary, [introduced FlowForge](https://flowforge.com/blog/2021/04/first-deploy/).
Since then major milestones have been achieved. As we grow as a company, important
steps are taken. Today we make another very important step; we're accepting our
first customers.

A few weeks ago our product was nearly in a state where it could support customers,
when that was the case, we [opened up our waitlist](...). The waitlist is growing
daily, a trend we're aiming to break today. The first lucky few users are being
added today, and each working day for the foreseeable future we'll continue
onboarding users. New users will receive an email from our team with their login
details and can start creating new workflows with Node-RED minutes after.

While the source code of FlowForge is [available](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge),
there's a chance you're unfamiliar with what has been built around Node-RED.
With FlowForge, our intent is to build a platform to aid with colaboration of
flows in Node-RED. The first steps to our vision include a managed Node-RED 
instance to connect virtually any online service. Multiple users will have
access to the same flows and can collaborate. Further, once Node-RED 3.0 has
been release, upgrading will take only a single click. There's many more
exciting features right around the corner on our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/flowforge/projects/5).
