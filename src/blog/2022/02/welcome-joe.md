Today we welcome Joe Pavitt ([@joepavitt3d](https://twitter.com/joepavitt3d)) as
our new Head of UX & Design. This is a key role that will help deliver the awesome
user experience of the FlowFuse platform.

Joe has a passion for user experience, data visualisation and creativity in
technology. He joins us having been at IBM for 9 years where he specialised in
building bespoke, first of a kind experiences in IBM's Emerging Technology and
Research teams.

We worked together at IBM and I saw first-hand the range and quality of what he
can do. I was super pleased when he agreed to join us and I look forward to
seeing the real impact he'll have on what we're building.

Welcome aboard Joe!
