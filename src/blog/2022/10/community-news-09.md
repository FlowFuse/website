[**FlowFuse 0.10**](/blog/2022/09/flowforge-010-released/)
Version 0.10 was released on 30th September. Our latest release includes some great new features, quality of life improvements and bug fixes. Notable additions included the ability to [Secure your HTTP endpoints](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/pull/893), [Add read-only users to your projects](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues/657) and [use our static IP address for outbound connections](/docs/cloud/introduction/#ip-addresses)

If you’d like to learn more about what else was included in 0.10 you can do so on our [blog post](/blog/2022/09/flowforge-010-released/), on our [GitHub release page](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/releases/tag/v0.10.0) and on our [Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/watch?v=mjR1iiEFiBg). We’d also love for more of you to get involved in the development of FlowFuse, [contributions to the code](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [bug reports](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues) are really appreciated.

[**Forest Fire Alerts Using ML, IOT and Node-RED**](https://hackster.io/user102774/fight-fire-wild-fire-prediction-using-tinyml-df7572)  
This fascinating project came up a few days ago and we wanted to share it with you all. The concept is to use a mesh network of IoT devices to monitor various indicators of potential and current wildfires and report data back to the relevant authorities. The system will use ML to predict wildfire risk levels and hopefully send warnings before a fire actually starts. The two developers [Muhammed](https://linkedin.com/in/zainmfd/) and [Salman](https://linkedin.com/in/salmanfarisvp/) are planning to use Node-RED to manage the reporting of fires to the authorities.
