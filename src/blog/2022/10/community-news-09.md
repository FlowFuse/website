[**Official Node-RED Docker Image Passes Milestone**](https://twitter.com/Docker/status/1559919666721693699?t=QBzGGzY2kJ12Z5aoi1QPTA)  
Docker has [announced](https://twitter.com/Docker/status/1559919666721693699?t=QBzGGzY2kJ12Z5aoi1QPTA) that the Node-RED Docker image has now been downloaded over 100 million times. They have also created a [guide to using Node-RED](https://www.docker.com/blog/build-retail-store-items-detection-system-no-code-ai/?utm_campaign=2022-08-17-brnd-nocode&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter) to Build and Deploy a Retail Store Items Detection System Using No-Code AI Vision at the Edge. We think it’s worth a read.
    
[**Forest Fire Alerts using ML,IOT and Node-RED**](hackster.io/user102774/fight-fire-wild-fire-prediction-using-tinyml-df7572)  
This faciniating project came up a few days ago and we wanted to share it with you all. The concept is to use a mesh network of IoT devices to monitor various indicators of potential and current wild fires and report that that data back to the relevant authorities. The [developer](linkedin.com/in/zainmfd/) is planning to use Node-RED to manage the reporting of fires to the authorities.
