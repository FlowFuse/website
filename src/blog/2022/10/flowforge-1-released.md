We're pleased to announce version 1.0 FlowFuse is now available. Keep reading for a promotion code to get your first month free on FlowFuse. Version 1.0 represents our vision of the base set of features needed for you to get great value from using FlowFuse in a production environment. That's not to say we are done, we will continue to add features, improve our interfaces and fix bugs with the same enthusiasm as we've worked towards 1.0. We'd like to hear your feedback on what we will be including in [1.1 and beyond](https://github.com/orgs/flowforge/projects/5).

## Features
[Standard Environment Variables set for both Projects and Devices](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/841)

Projects now get a set of predefined environment variables that can be used by their flows. These give your flows access to the projects unique id and name. When the flows are deployed to [devices](/docs/user/concepts/#device), they also get the device's id and name. That makes is easier to deploy flows across multiple devices and have each able to identify itself.

[Add additional node modules to your projects](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/405)
This feature allows you to pre-define additional Node-RED nodes and node modules you may want to be installed in your FlowFuse project, making it easier to manage.

[Import existing projects into FlowFuse](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/835)

You can now import your existing flow and credentials files straight into your FlowFuse project - making it really easy to move your existing projects into the platform.
