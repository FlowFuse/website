Since the [launch of FlowFuse][first-deploy] in April 2021 our goal has been to
build a low-code, enterprise-ready development platform based on Node-RED. We
wanted to make it easier for enterprises to adopt, integrate, and scale Node-RED
into their existing environments. We published our [first version][flowforge-01]
at the start of this year and have continued the journey to the
[launch of FlowFuse v1.0][flowforge-1] just last week. Each of these releases
has moved us towards our goal of creating a platform for integrating the
IT and OT for all organizations, built around an open core.

### FlowFuse is Node-RED for the enterprise
Node-RED is an incredible tool that has allowed many organizations to quickly
and easily integrate both their IT and OT. The sheer range and variety of
solutions created with Node-RED today go far beyond what we imagined. But we’ve
also seen the challenges faced by companies wanting to take their Node-RED
solutions into production and beyond.

This is where FlowFuse comes in. It addresses those challenges by adding
security, collaboration and deployment capabilities.

### Our $7.25M Seed Round
Today, we’re super excited to announce a $7.25M seed round led by Cota Capital,
joined by Westwave Capital, Uncorrelated Ventures, and Open Core Ventures. This
brings a huge amount of extensive knowledge and experience in IoT, open source,
enterprise-ready software solutions.

This investment will enable us to continue growing the team and platform to
realize our vision of FlowFuse being the best way to achieve enterprise-ready
Node-RED. It will enable us to invest back into the core Node-RED project to
further its development. One of our core company principles is around Open
Source Stewardship - the success of FlowFuse relies on a strong and successful
Node-RED community.

We’ll be bringing more collaboration features to the FlowFuse platform to
enable true collaborative, team-based working. We’ll expand our 
[Devices offering](/docs/user/concepts/#device) to make it
far easier to run Node-RED wherever it suits your use-case, from data center to
remote edge locations.

Above all, we’ll be building a company that is open, sustainable, and fun to
work at. We already have some job openings available - check out our 
[jobs board]({{ site.jobBoard }}) if you’re interested in joining our
team.
