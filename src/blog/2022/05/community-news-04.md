[Node-RED Beta on FlowForge](https://flowforge.com/blog/2022/05/node-red-3-beta-stack/)  
As promised in out 0.4 announcement, we've made the beta available to our users on FlowForge as a separate stack, this is just one way that we're able to demonstrate the flexibility you get from running Node-RED on FlowForge.

The team at Cisco DevNet published some great guides on using Node-RED to manage both your Meraki Access points and to integrate with WebEx Teams, they've also produced a handy [starter guide](https://blogs.cisco.com/developer/helloworldlowcodenodered01) for those that are new to Node-RED

[Node-RED Con 2022](https://nrcon.nodered.org)  
Our friends in the Node-RED Japan User Group have run a number of successful Node-RED conferences over the last few years. This year, we're joining forces with them to bring the event to a wider audience. The [Call for Papers](https://www.papercall.io/nrcon2022) is open now and we'd love to see your submissions.
