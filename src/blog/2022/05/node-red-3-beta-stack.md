The first beta of Node-RED 3.0 is here and FlowForge is ready for you to try it out.

When we released [FlowForge 0.4](/blog/2022/04/flowforge-04-released/) last month we talked about allowing users to select the stack their project runs on.
Until now we've only offered one stack which has been the latest Node-RED release (2.2.2) 

Yesterday the first beta of Node-RED 3.0 was [released](https://discourse.nodered.org/t/node-red-3-0-0-beta-1-released/62124), so as of today we have a choice of stacks, you can stick with the _Default_ and use Node-RED 2.2.2 or if you want to try out the beta you can select _Node-RED-3.0.0-beta-1_.

FlowForge is the best  way to run multiple Node-RED instances and different versions, betas are exciting but you don't want to risk your production applications with an early upgrade, so why not create a new project just to try things out.

We'll continue to update the stack choice with each beta as and when they are released.
