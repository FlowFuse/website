[**FlowFuse 1.0 Released**](http://flowforge.com/blog/2022/10/flowforge-1-released/)   
Version 1.0 was released on 27th October. Our latest release represents our vision of the base set of features needed for you to get great value from using FlowFuse in a production environment. That's not to say we are done, we will continue to add features, improve our interfaces and fix bugs with the same enthusiasm as we've worked towards 1.0. We'd like to hear your feedback on what we will be including in [1.1 and beyond](https://github.com/orgs/flowforge/projects/5). 

If you’d like to learn more about what else was included in 1.0 you can do so on our [blog post](http://flowforge.com/blog/2022/10/flowforge-1-released), on our [GitHub release page](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TLT7CQR7iI). We’d also love for more of you to get involved in the development of FlowFuse, [contributions to the code](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [bug reports](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues) are really appreciated.

[**Node-RED Nears 3.1 Release**](https://github.com/node-red/node-red/milestone/19)
The next release of Node-RED has some great new features including support for [locking flows in the editor](https://github.com/node-red/node-red/pull/3938) and [improving the user experience around hiding flows](https://github.com/node-red/node-red/pull/3930). We'd expect the first 3.1 beta to be available in November with a full release following shortly afterwards.
    
[**FlowFuse raises $7.25M to bring Node-RED to the Enterprise**](/blog/2022/10/seed-round-bring-node-red-to-enterprise/)  
Earlier this week, we announced a $7.25M seed round led by [Cota Capital](https://www.cotacapital.com/knowledgecapital/flowforge-closes-the-gap-between-it-and-ot), joined by Westwave Capital, Uncorrelated Ventures, and Open Core Ventures. This brings a huge amount of extensive knowledge and experience in IoT, open source, enterprise-ready software solutions. You can read more about what this investment means for FlowFuse in this [TechCrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/03/flowforge-nabs-7-2m-to-help-companies-integrate-iot-using-node-red).

[**Node-Red Dashboard - Beginners Guide**](https://stevesnoderedguide.com/node-red-dashboard)  
It's great to see members of the Node-RED community taking their personal time to help us all build better projects. This write up takes you through the basics of creating your first Dashboard through to more advanced techniques to help your interfaces look professional and provide great user experiences.
