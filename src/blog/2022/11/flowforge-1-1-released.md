## Features
[Node-RED Editor on Devices](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/1012) We've added the ability for you to edit flows directly on your Devices. 

[Persistant File Storage](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/998) We've completed the first steps to allow files to be created and persisted within your projects. This can be used to store files locally to log data or store current settings for later retrieval. 

[Import Snapshots from Outside FlowForge](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues/1165) You can now take flows created outside of FlowForge and easily import them into your projects. 

## Improvements

A lot of effort has been put in the install documentation in this release. Most
notably there's no requirement to setup Mosquitto in the local install method
and [updated all screenshots](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/pull/1189) after the redesign.
