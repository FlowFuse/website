I'm excited to share the news that Ben Hardill ([@hardillb](https://twitter.com/hardillb)) is joining FlowFuse as a Senior Engineer.

<!--more-->

I've known Ben for many years, having worked together at IBM. He's been an active member
of the Node-RED community since the start of the project and he published one of
the very first [3rd party nodes](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-node-geofence).

He is ever-present on Stack Overflow, to the point where I've long since stopped
rushing to respond to questions tagged with [`node-red`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node-red)
in the full knowledge that he has usually beaten me to it.

More recently he's been doing some really interesting work exploring [multi-tenant Node-RED systems](https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2020/10/01/multi-tenant-node-red/) - something we'll
be continuing at FlowFuse.

Welcome aboard Ben!
