If you run Node-RED in production, you already know the hard part is not building flows.

It is knowing what is running.  
It is understanding what changed.  
It is making improvements without breaking something people rely on.

FlowFuse 2.27 is about reducing those unknowns.

## Built for Production Reality

As Node-RED environments grow, complexity creeps in quietly. Flows live longer. Teams change. Context fades.

FlowFuse 2.27 focuses on making live systems easier to understand and operate, so confidence does not depend on tribal knowledge or guesswork.

You spend less time digging for context or second-guessing changes, and more time making deliberate, safe improvements.


## Clearer Systems, Lower Cognitive Load

Running automation in production carries responsibility. Every change has weight.

This release improves how FlowFuse helps teams stay oriented inside real, running systems, reducing the mental overhead of day-to-day operations.

When something goes wrong, you can reason about it faster.  
When nothing is wrong, you can still change things without fear.

That is what production tooling should enable.


## FlowFuse Expert: Help Without Giving Up Control

FlowFuse Expert continues to mature as a way to get faster insight into complex systems. It uses AI to surface explanations and context based on what is actually running, while keeping users firmly in control. FlowFuse Expert does not make changes or decisions without user intent.

You get help understanding your system. You keep ownership of it.


## Why 2.27 Matters

FlowFuse 2.27 is not about flash. It is about making production automation calmer, clearer, and safer to operate.

If your team relies on FlowFuse to run systems that cannot afford surprises, this release is for you.
