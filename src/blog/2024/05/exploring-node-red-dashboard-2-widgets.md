This guide delves into Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 widgets, teaching you how to build applications using them.

<!--more-->

If you're new to Dashboard 2.0, we recommend starting with the [Getting Started with Dashboard 2.0](/blog/2024/03/dashboard-getting-started/) guide and make sure to install it.

## What Are Widgets?

Widgets in Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 are like building blocks for creating the user interface. They're made of front-end pieces of code and work on the client's side. In Dashboard 2.0, you get a variety of widgets like forms, templates, buttons, and others to make different parts of your interface.

## Building Applications with Dashboard 2.0 Widgets

!["Income-expense tracker build with dashboard 2.0"](./images/exploring-dashboard-2-widgets-incom-expense-tracker-system.gif "Income-expense tracker build with dashboard 2.0"){data-zoomable}

In this guide, we'll create a basic app where you can input expenses and income. That will be displayed on the chart and table for analysis. This app will utilize a significant number of the widgets available in Dashboard 2.0, helping you understand and use them confidently. 

### Adding Forms

To enable income and expense submission, we'll incorporate a form using the **ui-form** widget.

1. Drag the **ui-form** widget onto the canvas.
2. Double-click on it to access various widget properties and select the **ui-group** where it should render.
4. Add date, description, amount, and note form elements by clicking the **+element** button at the bottom left.

!["Screenshot displaying Income submission ui-form's configuration"](./images/exploring-dashboard-2-widgets-income-submission-form.png "Screenshot displaying Income submission ui-form's configuration"){data-zoomable}

Once you've added the income submission form, repeat the process to add an expense submission form on another **ui-page** and **ui-group**, For more information on **ui-form**, refer to the [ui-form docs](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/nodes/widgets/ui-form.html).

!["Screenshot displaying Expense submission ui-form's configuration"](./images/exploring-dashboard-2-widgets-expense-submission-form.png "Screenshot displaying Expense submission ui-form's configuration"){data-zoomable}

### Storing Form Data

The **ui-form** widget emits a payload object with key-value pairs of form elements upon submission. We'll store this data in a global context, If you are not familiar with Node-RED context, refer to [Understanding Node-RED varriables](/blog/2024/05/understanding-node-flow-global-environment-variables-in-node-red/).

1. Drag a **function** node onto the canvas and use the following code which also contains a notification message set to payload:

```javascript
// Retrieve the existing 'income' array from the global context, or initialize it as an empty array if it doesn't exist
let income = global.get('income') || [];

// Push the incoming payload along with a 'type' property set to "income" into the 'income' array
income.push({
  ...msg.payload,
  type: "income",
});

// Store the updated 'income' array back into the global context
global.set('income', income);

// Set the message payload to a confirmation message for notification
msg.payload = "Thank you for submitting income!";

// Return the modified message
return msg;
```

Similarly, you can do this for storing expense data submitted using the expense submission form.

### Displaying Notifications

For displaying notifications on the dashboard, we'll utilize the **ui-notification** widget, which allows showing notifications at different positions on the dashboard. It accepts `msg.payload` to send string messages or raw HTML/JavaScript for custom formatting.

1. Drag the **ui-notification** widget onto the canvas.
2. Set the position property to **center**. You can also adjust colors or notification timeout by modifying the color and timeout properties. Please take a look at the [ui-notification docs](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/nodes/widgets/ui-notification.html#properties) for more information on **ui-notification**.

### Listening events 

In Dashboard 2.0, the **ui-event** widget allows you to listen to user behavior or events. It does not render any content or components on the dashboard. Currently, this widget only listens for page views and leaves events.

With this, we can listen for page view and page leave events and trigger tasks based on those events. For instance, in our application, we will be displaying a table containing income and expense data, along with a chart. We'll update them when navigating to a new page or leaving a page.

1. Drag an **ui-event** widget onto the canvas.
2. Double-click on it and select the correct **ui-base** of your application.

For more information on ui-event refer to [ui-event docs](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/nodes/widgets/ui-event.html).

### Retrieving Income-Expense Data

In our income-expense application, we will display the income and expenses in a single table.

1. Drag a **change** node onto the canvas.
2. Set `msg.payload` to the JSON expression below, which merges the income and expense arrays.
3. Connect the output of the **ui-event** widget to the input of the **change** node.

```javascript
[$globalContext('income'), $globalContext('expense')]
```

3. Connect the output of the **ui-event** widget to the input of the **change** node.

!["Screenshot displaying the change node setting JSON expression to payload for retrieving and sorting data."](./images/exploring-dashboard-2-widgets-change-node.png "Screenshot displaying the change node setting JSON expression to payload for retrieving and sorting data."){data-zoomable}

### Displaying Data on the Table

To display data on the table, we use the **ui-table** widget in Dashboard 2.0. This widget accepts an array of objects as input. The columns in the table correspond to the properties of the objects within the array, and each row represents a different object with values corresponding to those properties.

1. Drag a **ui-table** widget onto the canvas.
2. Create a new **ui-page** and **ui-group** for it.
3. Connect the output of the **change** node to the input of the **ui-table** widget.

!["Screenshot displaying the ui-table widget configuration"](./images/exploring-dashboard-2-widgets-table-widget.png "Screenshot displaying the ui-table widget configuration"){data-zoomable}

For more information on ui-table refer to [ui-table docs](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/nodes/widgets/ui-table.html)

### Calculating total category-wise 

In our application, we will display data on the chart, showing the total income and total expenses for analysis. In this section, we will calculate the total expenses and income using the function node.

1. Drag the two **change** node onto the canvas.
2. For the first **Change** node Set `msg.payload` to `global.income` and `msg.topic` to "income" and give it name "retrive income". For the second **Change** node, set `msg.payload` to `global.expense` and `msg.topic` to "expense" and give that second change node name "retrive expense".

!["Screenshot displaying the change node retrieving income data from global context"](./images/exploring-dashboard-2-widgets-chart-widget-retrieve-income-change-node.png "Screenshot displaying the change node retrieving income data from global context"){data-zoomable}

!["Screenshot displaying the change node retrieving expense data from global context"](./images/exploring-dashboard-2-widgets-chart-widget-retrieve-expense-change-node.png "Screenshot displaying the change node retrieving expense data from global context"){data-zoomable}

3. Drag a **Split** node onto the canvas.
4. Drag the **Change** node onto the canvas and set `msg.payload.amount` to the JSON expression `$number(payload.amount)` and give it name "Convert amount to number".

!["Screenshot displaying the change node converting amount to number"](./images/exploring-dashboard-2-widgets-chart-widget-convert-amount-to-number-change-node.png "Screenshot displaying the change node converting amount to number"){data-zoomable}

5. Drag a **Join** node onto the canvas, select mode as **reduced expression**, and set the **Reduce exp** to `$A + payload.amount`. Set Initial value to `0`, and **Fix-up exp** to `$A`. Give this **join** node the name "Calculate total". This function operates similarly to using the javascript reduce method on an array to calculate the sum of its values. `$A` stores the accumulated value, and with every incoming message payload, it adds the `payload.amount` value to it, for more details on this refer to the [core node docs on join node](/node-red/core-nodes/join/).

!["Screenshot displaying the join node calculating the total income and expense data"](./images/exploring-dashboard-2-widgets-chart-widget-calculate-total-join-node.png "Screenshot displaying the join node calculating the total income and expense data"){data-zoomable}

7. Drag an another join node onto the canvas set mode to manual, combine each to complete message, to create to array and After a number of message parts to 2 and give it name "combine two objects into array".

!["Screenshot displaying the join node combining the income and expense object into the array"](./images/exploring-dashboard-2-widgets-chart-widget-retrieve-combine-object-join-node.png "Screenshot displaying the join node combining the income and expense object into the"){data-zoomable}

7. Connect the output of the **ui-event** widget to the input of the **Change** node named "Retrieve Income" and "Retrieve Expense". Then, connect the outputs of the "Retrieve Income" and "Retrieve Expense" **Change** nodes to the input of the **Split** node. 

8. Next, connect the output of the **Split** node to the **Change** node named "Convert Amount to Number". Afterward, connect the output of that **Change** node to the input of the **Join** node named "Calculate Total". Finally, connect the output of the "Calculate Total" **Join** node to the input of the **Join** node named "Combine Objects into Array".

### Displaying data on the chart 

To display charts on the dashboard, we have to use the ui-chart widget which allows us to display different types of charts on a dashboard including linear, bar, scatter, etc. This accepts an array and object as input.

1. Drag a **ui-chart** widget onto the canvas.
2. Double-click on the widget and select Type as **bar**.
3. Configure the series to **category** and the y-axis to **amount**. This configuration informs the chart that the **amount** property of the input objects will be plotted on the y-axis of the chart.
4. Connect the output of the **ui-event** widget's output to the input of the **function** node and the **function** node's output to the **ui-chart** widget's output.

!["Screenshot displaying the ui-chart widget's configuration"](./images/exploring-dashboard-2-widgets-chart-widget.png "Screenshot displaying the ui-chart widget's configuration"){data-zoomable}

### Adding custom footer with ui-template

With the **ui-template** widget, we can add a custom component to our app using Vue.js. It also allows adding custom CSS for the dashboard and lot of other things. For more information refer to [ui-template docs](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/nodes/widgets/ui-template.html).

Using this widget, we will add a footer to our application.

1. Drag an **ui-template** widget onto the canvas.
2. Set the widget type (scoped UI) that will render this widget on the entire dashboard, eliminating the need to add separate footers for each page of the dashboard.
3. Insert the following vue.js code in the **ui-template** widget. 

```javascript
<template>
  <!-- Footer Component -->
  <div class="footer">
    <!-- Description of the Income-Expense Tracker -->
    <div>
      Welcome to our comprehensive income expense tracker! Take control of your finances by monitoring your income and
      expenses effortlessly. Our user-friendly interface makes it simple to record transactions, categorize expenses, and
