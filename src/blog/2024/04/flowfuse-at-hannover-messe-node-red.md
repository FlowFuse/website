## Understanding Node-RED

Node-RED, created by our co-founder Nick O'Leary, is a powerful open-source tool that makes it easy to connect industrial devices, collect data, and create insightful visualizations. Its intuitive interface and wide range of integrations have made it a popular choice in manufacturing.
