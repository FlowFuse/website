The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in various industries, particularly in manufacturing, is a topic of growing interest. The evolution of technologies like ChatGPT is driving significant changes in this sector. For a more nuanced understanding, we reference four informative blog posts from our team members. The first post, ["AI Use Cases that are shaping the next manufacturing frontier"](/blog/2023/12/ai-use-cases/), offers an insightful overview of AI's role in diverse areas. Following this, ["ChatGPT AI Assistants with Node-RED"](/blog/2023/11/ai-assistant/) examines the specific impact of AI assistants. The third article, ["Node-RED Builder a ChatGPT GPT"](/blog/2023/11/chatgpt-gpt/), discusses the capabilities of generative pre-trained transformers like ChatGPT. Lastly, ["How ChatGPT improves Node-RED Developer Experience"](/blog/2023/09/chatgpt-for-node-red-developers/) explores ChatGPT's application in Node-RED development, an important aspect for many in manufacturing.
