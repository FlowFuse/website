# Improving Our Security Posture
At FlowFuse, we understand that professionalizing Node-RED deployments for our clients means adhering to the highest standards, including SOC 2 requirements. This commitment is at the core of our security philosophy. In a world rife with cybersecurity threats and data breaches, taking information security seriously isn't just an optionâ€”it's a critical necessity. Our SOC 2 audit was far more than just a procedural step. It represented a comprehensive, independent third-party validation of our robust controls and processes. We believe in transparency and accountability, which is why we document our policies in our open handbook, inviting scrutiny from vendors and reinforcing trust with our customers. Providing this level of independent audit not only serves our customers better and more efficiently but also offers FlowFuse valuable insights into enhancing our security measures and identifying any gaps in our policies. This proactive approach ensures we continue keeping your data safe and secure at all times.
As we continue to grow and evolve, ensuring the security of our systems and data becomes ever more critical. The next step on FlowFuse's journey to provide independant proof we're on the right track: We're currently in the observation phase of the SOC2 type 2.

SOC 2 Type 1 assesses the design of an organization's security controls at a specific point in time, while SOC 2 Type 2 evaluates the effectiveness of those controls over a period of time, typically three to twelve months.

# FlowFuse's Journey to SOC 2 Compliance
## Compliance Partners

### Advantage Partners:
Working with Advantage Partners, our audit firm, was a seamless experience. Their expertise and support were vital in our efficient, successful attainment of SOC 2 compliance.

## Process
The journey to SOC 2 compliance, while extensive, was streamlined thanks to our partners. Vanta's integration with our systems and guidance on policies and procedures expedited our readiness. Following this, Advantage Partners evaluated our controls during our Type I audit and subsequently issued our report.

## Timeline
Achieving compliance is a significant undertaking. However, with dedicated focus and the right partners, we were able to fast-track our readiness from months to weeks. This preparation not only facilitated our current audit but also laid a foundation for more streamlined future audits.
