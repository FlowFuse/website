Have you ever wondered how to make your flows more efficient, reliable, and easier to manage when building flows in Node-RED? Like traditional programming, design patterns can offer reusable solutions to common problems, helping you create better workflows with less effort.

<!--more-->

In this guide, we’ll explore advanced design patterns for Node-RED. These patterns will help you build more robust and efficient Node-RED flows.

## Understanding Design Patterns

Before diving into the specific Node-RED design patterns, it’s essential to grasp what and why they matter.

**Design Patterns** are proven solutions to common problems in software design. They provide a template for solving specific issues and improving the design of your system. Originating from object-oriented programming, these patterns help create more efficient, maintainable, and scalable systems by providing reusable and adaptable solutions.

### Benefits of Design Patterns:

- Consistency: They help standardize coding practices and workflows, making collaborating easier for teams.
- Efficiency: They offer ready-made solutions that can be adapted to your needs, saving time and effort.
- Scalability: They assist in building systems that can grow and evolve without extensive rework.

## Node-RED Design patterns

### UI Design Pattern

User interface (UI) design patterns are reusable components that designers use to address common problems in user interface design. In this section, I have covered some of these design patterns. You can explore more options on the [FlowFuse dashboard(https://dashboard-demos.flowfuse.cloud/dashboard/)], where each page offers solutions for achieving unique UI components. You can read this [amazing docs](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/getting-started.html#design-patterns) on data synchronization and user management patterns for FlowFuse Dashboard. We may also cover more UI design patterns in future blog posts.

#### Form Validation and Feedback Pattern

The form validation pattern ensures data integrity by checking user input against predefined criteria. In the example flow, a phone number is validated using a regular expression to confirm its format before processing.

The feedback pattern informs users of any errors or missing information. If the validation fails, a notification is displayed, guiding the user to correct the input.

These patterns help maintain accurate data and improve the user experience by providing clear, actionable feedback.

{% endrenderFlow %}

The flow above demonstrates how to validate input submitted through a form. If the input meets the criteria, it is processed; otherwise, a notification prompts the user to correct errors. Note that basic validation, such as checking for required fields and ensuring correct data types (e.g., numeric values), is already handled by default by the FlowFuse Dashboard form widget. For further details, refer to the [UI-Form documentation](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/nodes/widgets/ui-form.html).

#### Navigation Patterns

A pattern for organizing and presenting navigation options in a way that helps users find and access different sections of an application or website.

{% endrenderFlow %}

In the above flow, you can see how to navigate through different dashboard pages programmatically. The FlowFuse Dashboard also allows you to control the view of groups along with pages. For more information, refer to the [UI-Control documentation](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/).

### While Pattern

The while pattern repeatedly runs a piece of code if a specific condition is true. It stops running when the condition becomes false. It is commonly used in software development to handle situations where the number of iterations is not predetermined and depends on dynamic conditions.

{% endrenderFlow %}

In the above flow, we have demonstrated a while loop using Node-RED to print the multiplication table of 2. The flow initializes a variable i, checks if it is less than 11, and prints the result of i * 2 for each iteration until i reaches 11.

### Sequence Pattern

The sequence pattern is a way of doing things in a specific order. Each step happens one after the other, following the previous one to complete the task. Node-RED, by default, follows this sequential approach, executing each step in the order it’s arranged.

{% renderFlow %}

In the flow above, we demonstrate how the Aggregator pattern can calculate the average of data from multiple sensors reading values. This flow utilizes the `node-red-contrib-aggregator` node, so make sure to install it. The aggregator node also supports calculating geometric mean, harmonic mean, median, minimum, and maximum values.

### Aggregator pattern

The Aggregate pattern combines and processes data from multiple sources into a single, unified result. It centralizes data management, making it easier to handle and maintain. Consolidating information simplifies interactions and reduces complexity. Calculations or transformations are often performed on the collected data to provide a comprehensive output. This Pattern is helpful in scenarios where multiple data points must be gathered and analyzed.

This flow utilizes the `node-red-contrib-aggregator` node, so make sure to install it. The aggregator node also supports calculating geometric mean, harmonic mean, median, minimum, and maximum values.

### Separator pattern

The Separator pattern in Node-RED is a design pattern used to organize and manage different types of data within a flow. This pattern helps separate distinct data streams and directs them to different outputs based on specific criteria or conditions. Doing so ensures that each type of data is processed independently, allowing for more modular and maintainable flows.

{% endrenderFlow %}

In the above flow, we demonstrated this pattern with an example where a timestamp is processed and split into its components: day, month, and year. Each component is then routed through separate outputs, allowing for individual processing of each timestamp part.

### MapReduce pattern

The MapReduce pattern is an efficient method for processing and generating large datasets by dividing the task into two key phases: Map and Reduce. In the Map phase, data is processed and transformed into key-value pairs, with each piece of data independently mapped to a set of intermediate results. The Reduce phase then aggregates or combines these intermediate results to produce the final output. This pattern is particularly useful for parallel processing, as it allows large datasets to be broken down and processed simultaneously.

She was known for her boundless curiosity and a heart full of dreams. Every day after her chores, she would wander into the forest, fascinated by the mysteries it held. The villagers warned her of the enchanted glade deep within the woods, a place where time stood still and strange things happened. But Lily's curiosity only grew stronger. One crisp autumn morning, as the leaves crunched beneath her feet, Lily ventured farther than she ever had before. The sunlight danced through the trees, leading her to a clearing she had never seen. In the center of the glade stood an ancient oak tree, its branches twisted into the sky, its roots sprawling out like fingers grasping the earth. At the base of the tree was a small, glowing pool, its water shimmering with colors that seemed to be from another world.","payloadType":"str","x":660,"y":440,"wires":[["a6f30da143093a3c"]]},{"id":"a6f30da143093a3c","type":"split","z":"4905164f6a425bac","g":"e0b8484fe0b27abd","name":"","splt":" ","spltType":"str","arraySplt":1,"arraySpltType":"len","stream":false,"addname":"","x":810,"y":440,"wires":[["6e52e304d031d10f"]]},{"id":"6e52e304d031d10f","type":"join","z":"4905164f6a425bac","g":"e0b8484fe0b27abd","name":"","mode":"custom","build":"array","property":"payload","propertyType":"msg","key":"topic","joiner":"\\n","joinerType":"str","accumulate":false,"timeout":"2","count":"","reduceRight":false,"reduceExp":"","reduceInit":"","reduceInitType":"","reduceFixup":"","x":970,"y":440,"wires":[["46d57c999befeffa"]]},{"id":"2e5d343ed7617a61","type":"debug","z":"4905164f6a425bac","g":"e0b8484fe0b27abd","name":"debug 1","active":true,"tosidebar":true,"console":false,"tostatus":false,"complete":"false","statusVal":"","statusType":"auto","x":1320,"y":440,"wires":[]}]
{% endrenderFlow %}

We have demonstrated this pattern with an example of calculating the frequency of each word in a paragraph. First, we split the paragraph into individual words and converted them into an array. Next, we used a function node to count the occurrences of each word. Finally, we created an object that displays the word count for each word.

### Batch Processing Pattern

The batch processing pattern involves gathering data into groups, or batches, and processing these groups together rather than handling each item individually. This approach efficiently manages large volumes of data or tasks that can be processed in bulk rather than in real-time. By processing data in batches, systems can improve efficiency, reduce processing overhead, and handle large-scale tasks more effectively.

{% endrenderFlow %}

In the above flow, we have demonstrated the batch processing pattern by calculating the mean of simulated sensor data collected every second. In this example, data is gathered into batches over a 5-second interval, and the mean is calculated for each batch. This approach allows us to process and analyze the data in groups rather than handling each individual data point in real time.

### Chain of Responsibility Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a design pattern used to pass a request through a series of handlers, where each handler can either process the request or pass it along to the next handler in the chain. It helps make systems more flexible and decouples the sender of a request from its receivers. Each handler only needs to know about the next handler in the chain, not the entire process, which makes the system more modular and more accessible to extend or modify.

{% endrenderFlow %}

In the above flow, the Chain of Responsibility Pattern is demonstrated using two example requests. Each handler in the chain processes the request based on its `type`. If a handler can handle the request, it processes it and updates the `processedBy` field. If the handler cannot process the request, it passes the request to the next handler in the chain.

### Timeout pattern

The Timeout Pattern is a design pattern used to handle situations where a process or operation must be completed within a specified time limit. If the operation is not complete within the given timeframe, it either fails, gets terminated, or some alternative action is taken. This Pattern helps ensure systems remain responsive and avoid hanging indefinitely due to slow or unresponsive components.

{% endrenderFlow %}

The flow above shows how the timeout pattern handles requests that take longer than 5 seconds.

### Throttle Pattern

The Throttling Pattern controls the rate at which requests or operations are processed to prevent system overload. It restricts the number of actions that can be performed within a specified time frame, ensuring fair resource usage and maintaining system stability. This pattern helps manage burst traffic and protects against abuse by limiting the rate at which requests are handled.

{% renderFlow %}

{% endrenderFlow %}

In the flow example, we demonstrate how to implement throttling using Node-RED. This setup controls the frequency of HTTP requests to prevent system overload and effectively manage request rates.

### Retry Pattern

The retry pattern is a design pattern used to handle transient failures by automatically retrying an operation or request a specified number of times before ultimately failing. This Pattern is helpful in scenarios where temporary issues might cause operations to fail, such as network glitches, temporary unavailability of a service, or brief database locks.

{% endrenderFlow %}

The above flow demonstrates the retry pattern by retrying HTTP requests with delays until a maximum retry limit is reached or a successful response is received.

## Best Practices to Follow

Adhering to best practices when building Node-RED flows is important to ensure data security, maintain clarity, and enhance performance. In this section, we will review some of these best practices and provide additional resources for further guidance.

### Using Environment Variables

We always recommend using environment variables for nodes that require configuration details. Since this data can be sensitive, it is crucial to avoid accidentally sharing flows that contain such information. Using environment variables helps prevent the accidental exposure of sensitive details and keeps your configuration secure.

For more information [Using Environment variable in Node-RED](/blog/2023/01/environment-variables-in-node-red/)

### Disabling the Node-RED Editor

Disabling the Node-RED editor can be beneficial in certain scenarios, such as preventing unauthorized access or accidental changes to your flows. This practice is particularly useful in production environments or when the Node-RED instance is exposed to the internet. While FlowFuse Cloud provides top-notch security, disabling the editor is still considered a best practice.
