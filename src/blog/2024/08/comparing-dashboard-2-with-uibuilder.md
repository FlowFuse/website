## How Easy is it to Install?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

When searching for `flowfuse/node-red-dashboard` on Google, the first result we get to the documentation, which is useful. However, in the Node-RED Palette Manager, finding the correct package can be confusing because Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 itself publishes some nodes and plugins to help the users. This can make it bit confusing for new users to locate the right package.

### UI-Builder

Finding UI-Builder is straightforward, as its package name `node-red-ui-builder` is distinct and easily identifiable both on Google and in the Node-RED Palette Manager. This clear naming helps users quickly locate the correct package.

## How Easy is it to Get Started?

## Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Getting started with Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 is relatively easy due to its low-code approach. It features a sidebar for managing UI widgets, themes, configurations, and settings, with intuitive navigation to the dashboard page. This makes it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

### UI-Builder

UI-Builder can be more challenging to start with, as it does not follow a low-code approach and lacks a separate sidebar for managing UI elements. Navigating the dashboard built with UI-Builder can be less straightforward, requiring users to have a deeper understanding of coding and UI design principles.

## How Easy is it to Migrate from Node-RED Dashboard ?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 is developed to replace the the deprecated standard Node-RED Dashboard. It retains the core concepts and UI elements but introduces more advanced options and configurations. To facilitate the transition, FlowFuse, the creator of Node-RED Dashboard 2.0, provides a [migration service](/product/dashboard/#migration-service) that simplifies migration of flows or projects from the Node-RED Dashboard to Node-RED Dashboard 2.0. This service helps ensure a smoother migration process with minimal disruption.

### UI-Builder

Migrating from Node-RED Dashboard 1 to UI-Builder is significantly more complex. UI-Builder does not follow the same concepts or provide the same UI elements as the Node-RED Dashboard. Users will need to recreate their dashboards from scratch, as UI-Builder relies on custom coding and frontend frameworks rather than the predefined, low-code widgets of Node-RED Dashboard. This process can be overwhelming and requires a solid understanding of HTML, CSS and the frontend frameworks if you wanted use.

## How Active is the Project's Development?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

[Node-RED Dashboard 2.0](https://github.com/FlowFuse/node-red-dashboard/graphs/contributors), which replaced Node-RED Dashboard 1.0 in 2023, has shown consistent and high development activity. The project benefits from a dedicated team that regularly updates and improves it, ensuring it remains current with user needs and technological advancements.

### UI-Builder

[UI-Builder](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/node-red-contrib-uibuilder/graphs/contributors) has been an active project for a long time and remains active. However, there has been a noticeable decline in development activity starting in early 2024. While the project continues to be maintained, it does not have a dedicated team and does not receive regular updates as frequently as some other projects.

## How Extensive is the Collection of UI Elements?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 offers an extensive set of UI elements, including forms, dropdowns, tables, charts, and gauges that are super easy to use. These widgets are built with complex Vue.js components, but users are completely shielded from this complexity, allowing them to focus on ease of use. Additionally, if you want to create your own custom widget, you can do so with the ui-template node that accepts complete Vue components. By default, Dashboard 2.0 supports the Vuetify library, which provides an extensive set of UI components.

## UI-Builder

UI-Builder also offers a number of widgets, but these are not as user-friendly as those in Dashboard 2.0. Users must send a JSON config object, which can be complex for new users who lack knowledge of HTML/CSS. Additionally, handling widget data requires using UI-Builder's methods, which can further increase complexity. However, UI-Builder's strength lies in its flexibility, allowing any HTML element to be used as a component, and it also supports the W3C standard web components. Despite this, users need to perform a lot of additional tasks to get everything set up and will have the hassle of writing things.

## How much dynamic insertion or update it support?

### Node-RED Dashboard

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 supports dynamically updating the UI via the msg object. Each UI widget supports the `msg.ui_update` property with a JSON object that allows you to update the UI components dynamically. For example, you can update form fields based on user input, dynamically insert or update options in a dropdown, or change the appearance of the UI by sending css classes.

### Ui-builder

UI-Builder also supports dynamic UI updates. Similar to Node-RED Dashboard, you can use messages to control the state and content of UI elements.

## Is creating visualizations easy in the Dashboard? ?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Visualization is a core use case for Node-RED, and Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 makes it easy with its built-in [chart](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/nodes/widgets/ui-chart.html) and [gauge widgets](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/nodes/widgets/ui-gauge.html). The chart widgets support various types, including line, bar, scatter, pie, and donut charts, while the gauge widgets offer options like tile, 3/4 gauge, and half gauge. This range of built-in options simplifies the creation of visualizations. Additionally, you can use Vuetify or other third-party libraries in the ui-template node if you need different types of charts.

### UI-Builder

UI-Builder does not provide built-in charting options. However, you can add charts using third-party libraries, which can make the visualization setup more complex and time-consuming. This approach requires additional effort to integrate and configure the libraries, potentially increasing the complexity of creating visualizations.

## How Fast and Easy is It to Communicate with Node-RED Instances?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 uses WebSockets for communication with Node-RED, enabling real-time and faster interactions. Most widgets uses the standard `msg.payload` for communication that makes it super easy to send the data from Node-RED client and vice-versa.

### Ui-builder 

The ui-builder also employs WebSockets for communication, providing real-time and fast interactions. However, it utilizes different types of msg properties, which can be complex for users and might increase the number of nodes unnecessarily for changing the property names.

## How many Web Layout Does It Support?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 offers three main predefined layouts to make it easy for users to get started quickly. These predefined layouts provide a solid foundation for most applications. However, if you need a different layout, Dashboard 2.0 allows for customization. Each element including the pages can have a custom class applied, and you can write your own custom styling using the ui-template. This flexibility ensures that you can tailor the dashboard to meet your specific needs while maintaining ease of use.

### UI-Builder

UI-Builder does not come with predefined layouts, which can make it more complex for users to get started. Instead, it provides the flexibility to define your own layout using CSS. This approach allows for complete customization, but it requires users to have a good understanding of HTML and CSS. The lack of predefined layouts means users have to create their own from scratch, which can be time-consuming.

## How Well Do They Support Different Devices and Screen Sizes?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 is designed with [responsiveness](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/layouts/) in mind. It ensures that dashboards adapt to different screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The dashboard elements are automatically adjusted to fit various resolutions, making it user-friendly for a wide audience.

### UI-Builder

UI-Builder's support for different devices depends on the user's implementation. While it offers the potential for responsive designs, but achieving this requires a good understanding of responsive design principles and CSS.

## How Much Customization is Available?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0, built on Vue.js, offers a range of customization options through its widget configurations and settings. While it provides predefined UI elements, users can modify styles and behaviors to fit their needs. Custom CSS can be applied using the [ui_template](/blog/2023/12/dashboard-0-10-0/) widget to enhance the dashboard's appearance. Additionally, this widget allows for the creation of custom components or widgets with Vue components and supports the integration of third-party libraries.

### UI-Builder

UI-Builder provides extensive customization capabilities, enabling users to build and style UI elements from scratch. This flexibility is advantageous for those with a strong background in frontend development, as it supports any frontend framework or custom design approach. However, achieving the desired results requires significant time and expertise, as users need to handle the coding and styling for each UI element they create.

## Does the Dashboard can be installed as an App?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 is built and deployed as a Progressive Web App. This means whilst it's built as a web application, it can be [installed on your mobile device](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/user/pwa.html#installing-dashboards-on-mobile) and run as a standalone application, behaving as if it was a native app.

### Ui-builder

Dashboards built with UI-Builder, on the other hand, cannot be installed as an app. It is designed as a web-based tool for building custom UIs and does not support installation as a standalone application.

## How About Performance and Speed?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 provides reliable performance with efficient real-time updates. Initial page load times might be slower, particularly on mobile, but the overall performance is consistent and effective for dynamic dashboards.

### UI-Builder

UI-Builder provides faster initial load times and smooth performance across customizations, ensuring high-speed interactions.

## How is the Overall User Experience?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 offers a user-friendly experience with its low-code approach, intuitive UI, and extensive documentation. Users can quickly create and customize dashboards without needing advanced coding skills, making it accessible to a wide range of users, from beginners to experienced developers. This allows users to focus on solving business problems and IoT tasks rather than getting bogged down by complex coding requirements.

###  UI-Builder

UI-Builder provides a more flexible but complex user experience. While it allows for greater customization and the use of any frontend framework, it requires a solid understanding of coding and design principles. This can be daunting for users without a background in web development, but it offers powerful capabilities for those who are comfortable with custom coding.
