## How Easy is it to Install?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

When searching for `flowfuse/node-red-dashboard` on Google, the first result we get to the documentation, which is useful. However, in the Node-RED Palette Manager, finding the correct package can be confusing because Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 itself publishes some nodes and plugins to help the users. This can make it bit confusing for new users to locate the right package.

### UI-Builder

Finding UI-Builder is straightforward, as its package name `node-red-ui-builder` is distinct and easily identifiable both on Google and in the Node-RED Palette Manager. This clear naming helps users quickly locate the correct package.

## How Easy is it to Get Started?

## Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Getting started with Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 is relatively easy due to its low-code approach. It features a sidebar for managing UI widgets, configurations, and settings, with intuitive navigation to the dashboard page. This makes it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

### UI-Builder

UI-Builder can be more challenging to start with, as it does not follow a low-code approach and lacks a separate sidebar for managing UI elements. Navigating the dashboard built with UI-Builder can be less straightforward, requiring users to have a deeper understanding of coding and UI design principles.

## How Active is the Project's Development?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

[Node-RED Dashboard 2.0](https://github.com/FlowFuse/node-red-dashboard/graphs/contributors), which replaced Node-RED Dashboard 1.0 in 2023, has shown consistent and high development activity. The project benefits from a dedicated team that regularly updates and improves it, ensuring it remains current with user needs and technological advancements.

## How Extensive is the Collection of UI Elements?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 offers an extensive set of UI elements, including forms, dropdowns, tables, charts, and gauges. This variety simplifies the creation of advanced dashboards, and the types of charts and gauges available continue to grow, enhancing functionality.

### UI-Builder

UI-Builder falls short in terms of available UI elements. It is better suited for users with a solid understanding of frontend frameworks, as it requires coding and styling for UI elements like charts and tables. This can be more time-consuming compared to Node-RED Dashboard 2.0.

## How Good is the Support and Documentation?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Support for Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 is robust, with assistance from both the FlowFuse team and the active Node-RED community. The documentation is comprehensive, easy to understand, and regularly updated. The team is also working on an interactive dashboard solution for previewing examples.

### UI-Builder

UI-Builder also has good support, with active contributions from the author and the Node-RED community. The documentation is detailed but can be complex due to the lack of a low-code approach, which might overwhelm some users.

## How Active is the User Community?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 boasts a large and active user community. Users frequently participate in forums, contribute to discussions, and share custom solutions. The number of weekly downloads is growing rapidly, reflecting its high activity and popularity.

## How About Performance and Speed?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 provides reliable performance with efficient real-time updates. Initial page load times might be slower, particularly on mobile, but the overall performance is consistent and effective for dynamic dashboards.

### UI-Builder

Offers faster initial load times and more consistent performance across customizations, but requires extensive setup and customization to achieve optimal results.

## How Fast and Easy is It to Communicate with Node-RED Instances?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 uses WebSockets for bidirectional communication with Node-RED, enabling real-time and faster interactions. Most widgets uses the standard `msg.payload` for communication.

### Ui-builder 

The ui-builder also employs WebSockets for bidirectional communication, providing real-time and fast interactions. However, it utilizes different types of msg properties, which can be complex for users and might increase the number of nodes unnecessarily for changing the property names.

## How Much Customizability is Available?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0, built on Vue.js, provides a range of customization options through its widget configurations and settings. While it offers predefined UI elements, users can adjust styles and behaviors to fit their needs. Custom CSS can be applied to enhance the appearance of the dashboard using the [ui_template](https://flowfuse.com/blog/2023/12/dashboard-0-10-0/) widget. This widget also allows for building custom components or widgets with Vue components and supports the import and use of third-party libraries.

### UI-Builder

UI-Builder offers a higher degree of customizability, enabling users to build and style UI elements from scratch. This flexibility is advantageous for those with a solid understanding of frontend development, as it supports the use of any frontend framework or custom design approach. However, it requires more time and expertise to achieve desired results, as users need to handle coding and styling for every UI element they create.

## How Easy is it to Migrate from Node-RED Dashboard ?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 is developed to replace the the deprecated standard Node-RED Dashboard. It retains the core concepts and UI elements but introduces more advanced options and configurations. To facilitate the transition, FlowFuse, the creator of Node-RED Dashboard 2.0, provides a [migration service](/product/dashboard/#migration-service) that simplifies migration of flows or projects from the Node-RED Dashboard to Node-RED Dashboard 2.0. This service helps ensure a smoother migration process with minimal disruption.

### UI-Builder

Migrating from Node-RED Dashboard 1 to UI-Builder is significantly more complex. UI-Builder does not follow the same concepts or provide the same UI elements as the Node-RED Dashboard. Users will need to recreate their dashboards from scratch, as UI-Builder relies on custom coding and frontend frameworks rather than the predefined, low-code widgets of Node-RED Dashboard. This process can be overwhelming and requires a solid understanding of HTML, CSS and the frontend frameworks if you wanted use.

## How Well Do They Support Different Devices and Screen Sizes?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 is designed with [responsiveness](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/layouts/) in mind. It ensures that dashboards adapt to different screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The dashboard elements are automatically adjusted to fit various resolutions, making it user-friendly for a wide audience.

### UI-Builder

UI-Builder's support for different devices depends on the user's implementation. While it offers the potential for responsive designs, but achieving this requires a good understanding of responsive design principles and CSS.

## How is the Overall User Experience?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 offers a user-friendly experience with its low-code approach, intuitive UI, and extensive documentation. Users can quickly create and customize dashboards without needing advanced coding skills, making it accessible to a wide range of users, from beginners to experienced developers. This allows users to focus on solving business problems and IoT tasks rather than getting bogged down by complex coding requirements.

###  UI-Builder

UI-Builder provides a more flexible but complex user experience. While it allows for greater customization and the use of any frontend framework, it requires a solid understanding of coding and design principles. This can be daunting for users without a background in web development, but it offers powerful capabilities for those who are comfortable with custom coding.

## What are the future development plans?

### Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 is actively working on enhancing its feature set. With extensive functionality already in place, the project also has ambitious plans to introduce more advanced features to better serve its users. You can track these developments on the [Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/FlowFuse/projects/15/views/4), where ongoing and upcoming features are documented.
