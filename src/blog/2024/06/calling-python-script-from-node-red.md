Have you ever needed to execute Python scripts from Node-RED? If so, this comprehensive guide is for you. We will walk you through the process of integrating Python seamlessly with Node-RED, alongside troubleshooting tips and techniques for passing arguments to scripts.

## Why use python with Node-RED

Node-RED is a powerful visual programming tool used for building IoT applications. It is built on Node.js, which meets IoT application needs with its asynchronous operations and event-driven, non-blocking architecture. Javascript on which Node.js is built and the Node-RED supports can handle a wide range of tasks, However, Python excels in specific areas such as complex computations and machine learning due to its extensive set of libraries.

Many users choose to integrate Python with Node-RED to leverage these strengths. By using Node-RED and Python together,  developers can create advanced IoT solutions that excel in computational tasks and analysis effectively.

## Installing Python

When executing Python scripts, it's essential to have the Python runtime installed on your system. Since Python is a prerequisite for npm, you might already have it installed if you installed Node-RED via npm 

To verify if Python is installed, open your terminal and execute:

```bash
python --version
```

!["Screenshot of terminal showing the python version installed, conforming it is installed"](./images/calling-python-script-from-node-red-py-conformation.png "Screenshot of terminal showing the python version installed, conforming it is installed"){data-zoomable}

The above command displays the version of Python installed on your system as shown in the above image. If the above command doesn't work, try:

```bash
python3 --version
```

The specific command to use depends on how Python was installed and configured on your system. However, make sure to use `python <filename>.py` if the first command works, or `python3 <filename>.py` if the second command works, while executing Python scripts.

## Executing Python Script from Node-RED

Let's now see how to call a Python script from Node-RED. First, we'll create a basic script file that contains a function to print text in the console based on input. Currently, the function uses hardcoded input. To create this file using Node-RED, import the following flow, deploy it and press the inject button:

{% renderFlow %}
[{"id":"b9d7d6aff0016631","type":"inject","z":"FFF0000000000001","name":"","props":[{"p":"payload"},{"p":"topic","vt":"str"}],"repeat":"","crontab":"","once":false,"onceDelay":0.1,"topic":"","payload":"","payloadType":"date","x":240,"y":100,"wires":[["2e1daccf2a7b3d0f"]]},{"id":"d2d1450deaa588f4","type":"file","z":"FFF0000000000001","name":"","filename":".\\example.py","filenameType":"str","appendNewline":true,"createDir":false,"overwriteFile":"true","encoding":"none","x":570,"y":100,"wires":[["e140a8508fb10d96"]]},{"id":"e140a8508fb10d96","type":"debug","z":"FFF0000000000001","name":"debug 1","active":true,"tosidebar":true,"console":false,"tostatus":false,"complete":"false","statusVal":"","statusType":"auto","x":760,"y":100,"wires":[]},{"id":"2e1daccf2a7b3d0f","type":"template","z":"FFF0000000000001","name":"","field":"payload","fieldType":"msg","format":"handlebars","syntax":"mustache","template":"def main():\n    # Hardcoded value\n    user_input = 20  \n    \n    # Check if the input is numeric\n    if isinstance(user_input, int) or (isinstance(user_input, str) and user_input.isdigit()):\n        number = int(user_input) if isinstance(user_input, str) else user_input\n        \n        # Conditionally render based on the input value\n        if number < 0:\n            print(\"Negative number entered\")\n        elif number == 0:\n            print(\"Zero entered\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Positive number entered\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid input.

{% endrenderFlow %}

Now, let's execute this Python script from Node-RED. To do that, we will use Node-RED's [Exec](/node-red/core-nodes/exec/) node, which allows running commands on your system.

1. Drag an Inject node onto the canvas.
2. Drag an Exec node onto the canvas and Configure the command to `python ./example.py -u`. The -u flag prevents potential output buffering issues when executing Python scripts via exec.

!["Screenshot of the Exec node executing python file"](./images/calling-python-scrpt-from-node-red-exec-node.png "Screenshot of the Exec node executing python file"){data-zoomable}

3. Drag a Debug node onto the canvas.
4. Connect the output of the Inject node to the input of the Exec node, and the output of the Exec node to the input of Debug node.

{% renderFlow %}
[{"id":"2e26b84c0ce17312","type":"exec","z":"FFF0000000000001","command":"python ./example.py -u","addpay":"","append":"","useSpawn":"false","timer":"","winHide":false,"oldrc":false,"name":"","x":460,"y":300,"wires":[["89589c56117004e0"],["7fdb901b144749c2"],["3f49b49308941782"]]},{"id":"739e08c1ec77c2a1","type":"inject","z":"FFF0000000000001","name":"","props":[{"p":"payload"},{"p":"topic","vt":"str"}],"repeat":"","crontab":"","once":false,"onceDelay":0.1,"topic":"","payload":"","payloadType":"date","x":240,"y":300,"wires":[["2e26b84c0ce17312"]]},{"id":"89589c56117004e0","type":"debug","z":"FFF0000000000001","name":"Output","active":true,"tosidebar":true,"console":false,"tostatus":false,"complete":"payload","targetType":"msg","statusVal":"","statusType":"auto","x":690,"y":260,"wires":[]},{"id":"7fdb901b144749c2","type":"debug","z":"FFF0000000000001","name":"Error","active":true,"tosidebar":true,"console":false,"tostatus":false,"complete":"payload","targetType":"msg","statusVal":"","statusType":"auto","x":690,"y":300,"wires":[]},{"id":"3f49b49308941782","type":"debug","z":"FFF0000000000001","name":"Return code","active":true,"tosidebar":true,"console":false,"tostatus":false,"complete":"payload","targetType":"msg","statusVal":"","statusType":"auto","x":710,"y":340,"wires":[]}]
{% endrenderFlow %}

Now, when you deploy this flow and click on the inject node to execute the file, you should see the text 'Positive number entered' and `{ code: 0 }`, which indicates your script has been successfully executed.

## Reading Temperature Sensor using Python script

Having explored how to run a Python script within Node-RED with the basic practical example, let's move to a real-world scenario. We'll demonstrate how to read sensor data using Python, despite Node-RED providing numerous community-built nodes for this purpose. This approach provides deeper insights into integrating external scripts, showcasing the flexibility of Node-RED for custom solutions.

Before proceeding, ensure that Node-RED is running on a device connected to a temperature sensor. For detailed instructions, refer to [Setting Up Node-RED on Different Hardware](/node-red/hardware/), In this case, we ae running Node-RED on a Raspberry Pi 5 with a DHT11 sensor connected to it.

1. Drag an Inject node onto the canvas, and set repeat to 1 seconds of interval.
2. Drag an Exec node and set the path to `python <filename>.py`, replace the filename with the name of the file which reads the sensor data, and make sure the python file doesn't contain the loop.
3. Drag the JSON node onto the canvas and set the action to "Always convert to JSON object".
4. Drag the Debug node onto the canvas.
5. Connect the output of the Inject node to the input of the Exec node and output of the Exec node to the input of the JSON node, and finally the JSON node's output to the input of the Debug node.

Below is the complete flow which creates the Python file to read the DHT11 sensor and executes that file after 1 second of interval. After deploying the flow you should able to see the sensor data on the debug sidebar as shown in the below image.

!["Image showing the Node-RED flow executing the python script that reads the sensor data"](./images/calling-python-scrpt-from-node-red-output.gif "Image showing the Node-RED flow executing the python script that reads the sensor data"){data-zoomable}

Note: The Python script uses the [adafruit-circuitpython](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/dht/en/latest/index.html) to read the sensor data so make sure to install it. Additionally, the code contained in the template node in the following flow considers that your sensor's signal pin is connected to GPIO 4.

{% endrenderFlow %}

## Executing Python Script with Arguments from Node-RED

Now, let's revisit our first example. In that example, we executed a simple Python file with a hardcoded value. Now, we'll learn how to pass arguments or inputs to the Python script when executing from Node-RED. For this, we'll need to update the file. Import the following flow, deploy it, and click on the inject button to create the file.

{% renderFlow %}
[{"id":"b9d7d6aff0016631","type":"inject","z":"FFF0000000000001","name":"","props":[{"p":"payload"},{"p":"topic","vt":"str"}],"repeat":"","crontab":"","once":false,"onceDelay":0.1,"topic":"","payload":"","payloadType":"date","x":300,"y":440,"wires":[["2e1daccf2a7b3d0f"]]},{"id":"d2d1450deaa588f4","type":"file","z":"FFF0000000000001","name":"","filename":"./example.py","filenameType":"str","appendNewline":true,"createDir":false,"overwriteFile":"true","encoding":"none","x":630,"y":440,"wires":[["e140a8508fb10d96"]]},{"id":"e140a8508fb10d96","type":"debug","z":"FFF0000000000001","name":"debug 1","active":true,"tosidebar":true,"console":false,"tostatus":false,"complete":"false","statusVal":"","statusType":"auto","x":820,"y":440,"wires":[]},{"id":"2e1daccf2a7b3d0f","type":"template","z":"FFF0000000000001","name":"","field":"payload","fieldType":"msg","format":"handlebars","syntax":"mustache","template":"import sys\n\ndef main():\n    if len(sys.argv) != 2:\n        print(\"Usage: python your_script.py <number>\")\n        return\n    \n    user_input = sys.argv[1]\n    \n    # Check if the input is numeric\n    if user_input.isdigit() or (user_input[0] == '-' and user_input[1:].isdigit()):\n        number = int(user_input)\n        \n        # Conditionally render based on the input value\n        if number < 0:\n            print(\"Negative number entered\")\n        elif number == 0:\n            print(\"Zero entered\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Positive number entered\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n","output":"str","x":460,"y":440,"wires":[["d2d1450deaa588f4"]]}]
{% endrenderFlow %}

1. Drag the Inject node onto the canvas.
2. Drag the Exec node onto the canvas, set the command to `python -u ./example.py <arg>`, and replace the `<arg>` with your argument.
3. Now Drag the Debug node onto the canvas.
4. Connect the output of the Inject node to the input of the Exec node, and the output of the Exec node to the input of the Debug node.

If you examine the Python file we've created, you'll notice the use of the 'sys' module, which allows us to read command-line arguments. In our context, we execute the command `python ./example.py -30`. By accessing `sys.argv[1]`, we retrieve the argument -30. The index 1 is used because `sys.argv[0]` provides the filename of the script being executed. Additionally, Python supports passing multiple arguments, so that you can pass as many arguments as you want.

{% renderFlow %}

{% endrenderFlow %}
