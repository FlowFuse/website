ETL is essential for data integration and analysis, playing a crucial role in many business contexts by helping to gain detailed business insights. Node-RED, known for its ease in creating IoT applications, has also been recognized for its potential in ETL tasks. When IBM published its blog on using Node-RED for ETL, the topic garnered significant attention and sparked discussions on whether it could be effectively utilized for ETL. In this guide, we'll explore how to use Node-RED for ETL, discussing both its strengths and weaknesses along the way.

## What is ETL

[ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) (Extract, Transform, Load) is a fundamental process in data integration and data warehousing. It encompasses three main stages: extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a format suitable for analysis, and loading it into a target database or data warehouse. This process allows businesses to consolidate data from multiple sources, ensuring it is clean, consistent, and ready for generating insights and making informed decisions.

## Node-RED as ETL a tool

Node-RED is specifically used for building various types of IoT applications. During the development of such applications, Node-RED is sometimes used as an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool without even realizing it. For instance, when monitoring sensors across a facility, the process involves extracting data from sensors, transforming (cleaning and formatting) sensor data, and loading it into a database. There are thousands of other examples like this. This demonstrates that Node-RED has already been adopted as an ETL tool for certain scenarios.

### Extracting

Node-RED can extract data from various sources, including APIs, databases, local filesystems, and IoT devices using built-in nodes and community-contributed nodes. For example, the HTTP request node can be used to pull data from web services, while nodes for MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL can extract data from databases. Nodes for MQTT and Kafka can fetch data from message brokers. Additionally, there are cloud nodes such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and IBM Watson that allow extraction of data from cloud storage services.

### Transforming

Transformation in Node-RED involves converting data into the desired format, applying business rules, and cleaning it. This can be done using function nodes for custom JavaScript code, along with nodes like JSON, split, join, change CSV, and XML for parsing and formatting.

### Loading

The final step in the ETL process is loading the transformed data into a target system, such as a database or data warehouse. Node-RED supports various output nodes to send data to different destinations. For instance, you can use the MySQL node to insert data into a MySQL database, or the HTTP request node to send data to a web service endpoint.

### Visualizing and Analyzing

In addition to the core ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, visualizing and analyzing data is a crucial step for gaining insights. While visualization isn't part of the ETL acronym itself, it plays a significant role in understanding and interpreting transformed data. In Node-RED, you can easily visualize data using Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 charts.

Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 provides several chart options, and more are expected in the future. For more information and to explore available chart types, refer to the [Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 charts documentation](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/nodes/widgets/ui-chart.html).

*Note: We have mentioned only a few nodes that can be used in the ETL process, but there are thousands of other nodes that you can explore yourself by visiting the [Node-RED Nodes Library](https://flows.nodered.org/search?type=node)*

## Building a Simple ETL Project Using Node-RED

Let's walk through a simple project where we use Node-RED as an ETL tool to extract sample customer data from an API, transform it, and then load cleaned data into a MongoDB database and process data into a local file.

*Note: The goal of this project is to understand how to utilize Node-RED as an ETL tool. We assume that the reader has a basic knowledge of Node-RED.*

## Prerequisite 

Before proceeding further make sure you have installed the following nodes.

1. [node-red-contrib-mongodb4](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-mongodb4)
2. [@flowfuse/node-red-dashboard](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/)

## Extracting Data

1. Drag an Inject node onto the canvas.
2. Drag an HTTP Request node onto the canvas, double-click on it, and set the URL to `https://api.slingacademy.com/v1/sample-data/files/customers.json`.
3. Drag a Link Out node onto the canvas.
4. Connect the Inject node's output to the input of the HTTP Request node, and the HTTP Request node's output to the input of the Link Out node.

Now, if you add a Debug node after the HTTP Request node, you will see an array of objects containing customer data in the Debug panel. Each object has properties such as `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and others.

Next, we'll perform a transformation to replace the existing properties `first_name` and `last_name` with a single property `full_name` that concatenates them. We'll cover this transformation in the next section.

## Transforming Data

### Data Cleaning

1. Drag a Link In node onto the canvas, double-click on it, and select the name of the Link Out node added in the above section.
2. Drag a Split node onto the canvas.
3. Drag a Change node onto the canvas and Set `msg.payload.full_name` to `payload.first_name & " " & payload.last_name` as the JSONata expression, then delete unnecessary properties like `first_name` and `last_name`.
4. Drag a Join node onto the canvas.

until now we have created a flow that will create a new property in customer data objects called full_name and then it will delete the unnecessary properties. in summary, we have cleaned the data according to our needs.

### Customer Data Deduplication

1. Drag a Change node onto the canvas, and set `msg.data` to `msg.payload` and `msg.payload` to `[]`.
2. Drag a MongoDB4 node onto the canvas, and configure it with your correct details. If you haven't used MongoDB with Node-RED, please refer to the [Node-RED MongoDB documentation](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-mongodb4). Enter `find` into the Operation field.
3. Drag a Function node onto the canvas and insert the following code into it:

```javascript
// Check if previously stored customer data is present, and ensure it's an array
let previously_stored_customer_data = Array.isArray(msg.payload) ? msg.payload : (msg.payload ? [msg.payload] : []);

// Ensure latest customer data is an array
let latest_customer_data = Array.isArray(msg.data) ? Array.from(msg.data) : (msg.data ? [msg.data] : []);

// Check if both previously stored and latest customer data are not empty
if (latest_customer_data.length !== 0 && previously_stored_customer_data.length !== 0) {
    // Extract emails from previously stored customer data
    let emailArray1 = previously_stored_customer_data.map(customer => customer.email);

    // Filter out customers that are already in previously stored data
    let filtered_customer_data = latest_customer_data.filter(customer => !emailArray1.includes(customer.email));

 msg.payload = filtered_customer_data; 
    return msg;
} else {
    // Case where there's no previously stored data (first ETL cycle after deploying flow)
 msg.payload = latest_customer_data;
    return msg;
}
```

4. Drag a Link-out node onto the canvas.

Now, we have added some more nodes that perform data deduplication. This means we will create a new array containing unique data that is not already stored in the database to avoid data duplications.

## Data Processing

1. Drag a Function node onto the canvas and insert the following code into it:

```javascript
let data = msg.payload;

// Initialize counters
let ageRanges = {
    "0-20": 0,
    "21-30": 0,
    "31-40": 0,
    "41+": 0
};

let genderTotals = {
    male: 0,
    female: 0,
    other: 0  // Default to 'other' if gender is not specified
};

let jobStatusTotals = {};

// Process each document in the data array
data.forEach(doc => {
    // Calculate age range
    let age = parseInt(doc.age);
    let ageRange;
    if (age <= 20) {
        ageRange = "0-20";
 } else if (age <= 30) {
        ageRange = "21-30";
 } else if (age <= 40) {
        ageRange = "31-40";
 } else {
        ageRange = "41+";
 }
 ageRanges[ageRange]++; // Increment age range count

    // Count gender
    let gender = doc.gender || 'other'; // Default to 'other' if gender is not specified
 genderTotals[gender]++;

    // Count job status
    let job = doc.job || 'Unknown'; // Default to 'Unknown' if job is not specified
    if (jobStatusTotals[job]) {
 jobStatusTotals[job]++;
 } else {
 jobStatusTotals[job] = 1;
 }
});

// Prepare output payload
msg.payload = {
    "Age Ranges": ageRanges,
    "genderTotals": genderTotals,
    "JobStatus Totals": jobStatusTotals
}; 

return msg;
```
2. Drag another Link-out node onto the canvas.

Finally, in this phase of transformation, we are tallying the total number of users based on age, gender, and job title. This allows us to quickly analyze and understand our user demographics based on these details so that later we can visualize this data easily.

## Loading data

1. Drag a Link-in node onto the canvas, double-click on it, and select the name of the Link-out node connected to the data deduplication function. Then, drag another Link-in node and connect it to the Link-out node connected to the data processing function node.

2. Drag a MongoDB4 node onto the canvas and configure it correctly. Select the correct collection and enter `insertMany` into the Operation field.

3. Drag a File Write node onto the canvas, set the path, and select the action to "override".

## What are the limitations of using ETL as an ETL tool

While Node-RED is versatile, there are some limitations to consider:

- **Scalability:** Node-RED might struggle with extremely large datasets compared to dedicated ETL tools.
- **Performance:** For very complex transformations or high-volume data, performance might not match that of specialized ETL solutions.
- **Advanced Features:** Some advanced ETL features, like automated schema detection and sophisticated error handling, might require additional customization or external modules.
- **Data Governance:** Node-RED does not inherently provide robust data governance and lineage tracking which are often essential in enterprise ETL tools.

## Benefits of using Node-RED as an ETL tool.

Despite its limitations, Node-RED offers several benefits:

1. **Ease of Use:** Its visual programming interface makes it accessible to non-developers.
2. **Flexibility:** A wide range of nodes and the ability to write custom JavaScript allow for flexible data processing.
3. **Integration:** Strong support for IoT and real-time data processing, making it ideal for integrating diverse data sources.
4. **Cost-Effective:** Being open-source, Node-RED can be a cost-effective alternative to expensive ETL tools.
5. **Community Support:** A large community provides a wealth of nodes, examples, and support.
