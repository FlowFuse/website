When it comes to modern industrial operations, data is vital to decision-making. On every factory floor, machines and humans work side by side, each contributing to the production of the final product. But beneath the surface, there's an invisible current flowing—data. It's constantly being collected, analyzed, and acted upon to ensure that every piece of equipment operates efficiently, potential issues are detected early, and production stays on track. Without this constant stream of information, the entire operation could grind to a halt.

Yet, the road to seamless data communication in industrial environments isn’t always smooth. The rise of protocols like MQTT has transformed how machines communicate, but it also brings its own challenges. Historically, factories operated like busy beehives where sharing information was often a challenge. Decisions relied on instinct and visible cues, sometimes leading to confusion, as data was frequently siloed and hard to use effectively. As technology progressed, the importance of real-time data became clear, driving the need for better communication between devices.

This need led to the creation of [MQTT](/node-red/protocol/mqtt/) (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) in the early 2000s. Designed as a lightweight messaging protocol, MQTT enables efficient communication between machines and devices, even in resource-limited environments. Its rise coincided with the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), making device connectivity essential.

Today, MQTT has become the de facto standard for industrial data communication, celebrating over 25 years of transforming industry operations. However, as new protocols have emerged during this time, each with unique advantages and mechanisms, organizations may find it challenging to determine when to use MQTT versus other options. This growing diversity raises important questions about the most effective approaches in various scenarios.

As we transition into discussing the pitfalls associated with MQTT, it’s crucial to recognize how these challenges can impact data operations. By understanding these potential hurdles, organizations can make informed decisions that enhance their communication strategies and overall operational efficiency.

## Common Challenges with MQTT in Industrial Data Operations

The challenges we’re about to explore depend on the specific use cases of organizations. While each of these pitfalls has its benefits and can enhance MQTT’s effectiveness in certain scenarios, they also present obstacles that may hinder data operations. By recognizing these challenges, organizations can proactively address them, ultimately leading to improved communication and more efficient industrial processes.

### Lack of Standardization in Data Formats and Data Quality Concerns

In industrial environments, effectively leveraging data is crucial for decision-making and operational efficiency. This data is often collected from various parts of the IoT environment. However, for data to be truly useful, it must always be transferred in a format that the end application can understand and process. 

A significant challenge with MQTT is its **lack of enforced standardization** for data formats. While this flexibility can be beneficial, it often leads to the necessity for data transformation, that adds extra layer of complexity and creating bottlenecks that hinder efficiency.

This lack of standardization can also result in **low-quality data**. Inconsistent or poorly structured data complicates analysis, making it difficult to derive actionable insights. Consequently, decisions may rely on unreliable information, undermining efforts for operational excellence. These challenges underscore the pressing need for robust frameworks and standards, such as [**Sparkplug B**](/blog/2024/08/using-mqtt-sparkplugb-with-node-red/), to ensure data consistency and quality in industrial operations. 

### Risks of Data Loss and Delivery Issues

In addition to ensuring data is high-quality and standardized, industries must also tackle the risks of **data loss**, **data duplication**, and **out-of-order delivery**. In industrial settings, timely and accurate information is essential; losing critical data can lead to operational disruptions, while duplicates and out of order data can skew analyses and hinder decision-making. 

MQTT inherently raises these concerns due to its design and operational mechanisms. For instance, if there are network interruptions during transmission, important information may not reach decision-makers. Consequently, organizations might operate on unreliable data, leading to suboptimal decisions that can adversely affect efficiency and safety. Additionally, consider a manufacturing process where a robotic arm is controlled by sequential commands. If a command to stop is received before a command to move, the robotic arm could behave unpredictably, potentially causing accidents or damaging equipment. These scenarios underscore the critical need for reliable data transmission and highlight the potential risks associated with MQTT's inherent limitations.

To address these challenges, MQTT introduced **Quality of Service (QoS) levels**. The default behavior of QoS 0 does not guarantee message delivery or the order of delivery, but it provides low latency. In contrast, QoS 1 ensures that messages are delivered at least once, while QoS 2 guarantees that messages are delivered exactly once and in the correct order. However, these higher QoS levels can introduce their own complexities, including increased overhead and potential delays in message delivery, which may be unacceptable in time-sensitive industrial environments. Therefore, it is crucial for industries to carefully evaluate and select the appropriate QoS level based on their specific operational needs and tolerance for data loss, latency, and order of delivery.

### Lack of Acknowledgment Mechanisms

While the challenges of data loss and duplication in MQTT stem from its publish-subscribe architecture, another significant limitation is the **absence of an acknowledgment mechanism** for message delivery. Unlike traditional communication models, such as request-response, where a sender receives immediate confirmation that a message has been successfully transmitted and received, MQTT does not inherently provide such assurances. Consequently, there is no straightforward way to verify data transmission; users can only infer successful communication by observing corresponding changes in the end application or device.

Although this lack of visibility can create uncertainty, acknowledgment logic can be implemented to address the issue. This involves additional development to create tracking mechanisms, such as having subscribers publish a response to another topic once they receive data, while the publisher subscribes to that topic. However, this complexity may complicate integration into existing workflows

### TCP Limitations in MQTT Frameworks

Moreover, MQTT **operates over the TCP protocol**, which introduces several challenges for industrial environments.

First, TCP requires significant processing power and memory since it maintains a connection state between devices. This demand can be particularly challenging for low-power systems. Low-power devices often enter sleep mode when inactive to conserve energy. However, the TCP handshake protocol necessitates that these devices periodically wake up to maintain their connections with the network. This frequent waking can quickly drain their batteries and may hinder overall operational efficiency.

Second, all MQTT clients must support TCP/IP, which can limit the deployment of certain low-power devices that may not have the capability to handle these requirements.

### Lack of Built-in Security Mechanisms

Another critical challenge associated with MQTT is the **lack of built-in security mechanisms** within the protocol itself. While MQTT can use TLS to encrypt transmitted data, it does not do so by default. The effectiveness of these protections hinges on proper implementation; therefore, organizations must recognize the importance of configuring TLS/SSL correctly to ensure secure communications.

Moreover, relying solely on secure transport layers is insufficient. It becomes crucial to implement additional security measures at different levels. For example, at the network layer, the use of firewalls, VPNs, and IPsec can help prevent intruders. At the application level, implementing username and password authentication along with access controls ensures that only authorized individuals can publish and subscribe to the broker. Selecting the right broker services is equally important, as many brokers offer essential security features that enhance overall protection. Additionally, continuous monitoring of network activity is vital to safeguard data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.

Without these robust security measures in place, MQTT communications can become targets for potential breaches, exposing sensitive data and undermining operational efficiency.

### Single Point of Failure and The Risks of Vendor Lock-In

In industrial operations, MQTT is commonly used as a central broker for data flow, meaning all the information from your IoT devices passes through this single broker. If the broker goes down, it can cause major disruptions, So, while using MQTT, it becomes crucial that you have a clear strategy for managing your broker. This includes ensuring high availability and implementing backup solutions to minimize disruptions.

Furthermore, one significant pitfall of using MQTT is the potential for **vendor lock-in**. Many organizations may choose a specific MQTT broker or service provider based on their initial requirements, but as their operations grow and evolve, they may find it difficult to migrate to another solution. This challenge arises because different brokers may have unique features, configurations, and proprietary extensions that can complicate the migration process. The more tightly integrated a broker is with an organization’s existing systems and workflows, the harder it becomes to switch to an alternative without incurring substantial costs or operational disruptions.

Additionally, vendor lock-in can limit flexibility and innovation, forcing organizations to adapt their processes to fit the broker's capabilities rather than the other way around. If the chosen broker lacks essential features or scalability options, organizations may be stuck with inadequate solutions that do not meet their evolving needs.
To mitigate the risks associated with **vendor lock-in**, it becomes important for organizations to prioritize interoperability when selecting an MQTT broker. Opting for open-source solutions or platforms that support standard can facilitate smoother transitions between different services.
