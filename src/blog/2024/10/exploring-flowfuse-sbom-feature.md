In recent times, open-source projects have become the backbone of the software industry. These projects are free to use, widely adopted, and regularly maintained by active communities to ensure they remain secure. Node-RED, for example, benefits from a dedicated community that updates and monitors the core platform. However, not all open-source projects or components are maintained with the same level of attention. This can lead to security risks and vulnerabilities, particularly with third-party nodes in Node-RED's vast ecosystem. While some nodes have a solid community to contribute, update, and monitor, others may not receive regular updates or security patches, which introduces potential vulnerabilities.

To address this challenge, FlowFuse has introduced the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) feature, which helps users maintain security. This guide will explore what an SBOM is and how it helps secure your Node-RED projects.

## What is an SBOM, and How Does It Enhance Security?

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a detailed list of all the components that make up a software application, just like how a bill of materials for a physical product lists every part used in its construction, an SBOM provides a breakdown of all the software libraries, packages, and dependencies used in a project.

This transparency is crucial for security, allowing developers and organizations to track what’s inside their software. By knowing precisely what components are in use, you can quickly identify outdated or vulnerable dependencies that may pose security risks. An SBOM helps you monitor third-party nodes, ensuring that any related security issues can be addressed promptly and reducing the chance of vulnerabilities being exploited.

## Exploring the FlowFuse SBOM Feature

**[FlowFuse](/)** is a platform that makes it easy to remotely manage multiple Node-RED instances from one place. It helps teams collaborate efficiently, share resources, and scale applications with a user-friendly interface. FlowFuse also includes strong security features to prevent unauthorized access and advanced controls to manage the security of each team and application, allowing you to group and manage your Node-RED applications effectively.

### Accessing FlowFuse SBOM Interface

The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) interface is available at the application level. For more information on the application, refer to the [Documentation](https://flowfuse.com/docs/user/concepts/#application). To access it:

1. Navigate to your Node-RED application within the FlowFuse platform.

*Note: This feature is only available for FlowFuse Enterprise self-hosted and Enterprise Tier users.*

### Understanding What the SBOM Interface Shows

Once you navigate the tab, you will see a list of all the packages installed within your Node-RED Cloud instances and devices associated with that application. This includes the package names and versions, the number of devices and instances using each version, and additional details such as the latest available version of each package and the time since its release.

### Now What? Make the Most of SBOM

Now that you've explored the SBOM interface, you can use it to enhance the security of your Node-RED applications:

1. **Monitor Regularly**: Check your SBOM often to identify outdated or vulnerable packages. Staying updated can prevent potential security threats.

2. **Upgrade Packages**: If you find any packages flagged for vulnerabilities, upgrade them promptly. This will help secure your application and improve performance.

3. **Assess Third-Party Nodes**: Review the third-party nodes you use. If any lack regular updates, consider alternatives to ensure your application remains secure and well-maintained.

Adopting these practices in your development routine will enhance your applications' security and cultivate a proactive maintenance culture. Security is a team effort, and staying vigilant about your dependencies is essential for protecting your projects. The FlowFuse SBOM feature is an invaluable auditing tool, accessible to all team members with the appropriate permissions, allowing everyone to contribute to maintaining security seamlessly.
