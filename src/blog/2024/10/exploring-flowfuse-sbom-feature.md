FlowFuse recently launched Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for enterprise customers. This powerful tool enhances security and management within projects, particularly in the Node-RED ecosystem. As open-source libraries and software continue to play a pivotal role in the industry, monitoring third-party components used in projects becomes essential. The SBoM enables organizations to track dependencies and identify vulnerabilities, ensuring compliance and mitigating risks.

## What is an SBOM, and How Does It Enhance Security?

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a detailed list of all the components that make up a software application, just like how a bill of materials for a physical product lists every part used in its construction, an SBOM provides a breakdown of all the software libraries, packages, and dependencies used in a project.

This transparency is crucial for security, allowing developers and organizations to track what’s inside their software. By knowing precisely what components are in use, you can quickly identify outdated or vulnerable dependencies that may pose security risks. An SBOM helps you monitor third-party nodes, ensuring that any related security issues can be addressed promptly and reducing the chance of vulnerabilities being exploited.

## Exploring the FlowFuse SBOM Feature

**[FlowFuse](/)** is an industrial data platform that empowers engineers to build, manage, scale, and secure their Node-RED solutions for digitalizing processes and operations at the edge. It enables customers to seamlessly integrate IT and OT environments, allowing teams to quickly connect, collect, transform, and visualize data to optimize industrial workflows.

### Accessing FlowFuse SBOM Interface

The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) interface is available at the application level. For more information on the application, refer to the [Documentation](https://flowfuse.com/docs/user/concepts/#application). To access it:

1. Navigate to your Node-RED application within the FlowFuse platform.

*Note: This feature is only available for FlowFuse Enterprise customers.*

### Understanding What the SBOM Interface Shows

Once you navigate the tab, you will see a list of all the packages installed within your Node-RED Cloud instances and devices associated with that application. This includes the package names and versions, the number of devices and instances using each version, and additional details such as the latest available version of each package and the time since its release.

### Here’s How You Can Use SBOM

Now that you've explored the SBOM interface, here are ways to enhance the security of your Node-RED applications:

1. **Monitor Regularly**: Check your SBOM often to identify outdated or vulnerable packages. Staying updated can prevent potential security threats.

2. **Upgrade Packages**: If you find any packages flagged for vulnerabilities, upgrade them promptly. This will help secure your application and improve performance.

3. **Assess Third-Party Nodes**: Review the third-party nodes you use. If any lack regular updates, consider alternatives to ensure your application remains secure and well-maintained.

Adopting these practices in your development routine will enhance your applications' security and cultivate a proactive maintenance culture. Security is a team effort, and staying vigilant about your dependencies is essential for protecting your projects. The FlowFuse SBOM feature is an invaluable auditing tool, accessible to all team members with the appropriate permissions, allowing everyone to contribute to maintaining security seamlessly.
