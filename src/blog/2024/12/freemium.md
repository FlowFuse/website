Title: New Free Forever Plan
Subtitle: With release N.NN comes a new Free plan

Body: FlowFuse N.NN is focused on getting you started with managing edge devices, at no cost to you.

The new Free plan on FlowFuse Cloud will allow you to manage two edge devices using FlowFuse Device Agent, completely free of charge, forever! The new plan also provides Device Auto Snapshots, so any changes to your Node-RED flows running on your devices are backed up automatically.

**Setting Up Your Team**

The new Free plan is all about getting started with remote device management. Here’s what you’ll need: 
 
- A free team
- An installation of Device Agent on your devices

The rest of this announcement will walk you through how to set those up.

**Creating a Free Team**

To create a free team, sign up at app.flowfuse.com/create. You will automatically join the Team tier on a free trial. (We will enable you to sign up directly for the Free tier and bypass this step in a subsequent product update.) Delete the instance that is created for you automatically. Reload the page.

Now, navigate to Team Settings and select Change Team Type, and choose Free. 

Depending on the age of your account, you may be asked to check out for $0. You will not be charged. (In a subsequent update, new users will be able to skip this step.)

You are now signed up on a free forever team! 

**Create an Application**

On the Free plan, you will need to create an Application before you can assign a device to it. From the Applications page, click Create Application

Complete the form, and you will have a new application in your team.

**Install Device Agent**

You will need to install Device Agent on your edge devices. Follow these steps to install Device Agent and connect your devices to FlowFuse: https://flowfuse.com/docs/device-agent/quickstart/ .

You can now manage your edge devices from within FlowFuse!
