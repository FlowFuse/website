## From Community Contribution to Professional Partnership

The Node-RED community has always had a pasionate and thrived on the
domain-expertise of its developers. The community has created an environment of
innovation, and now we're taking the next step to support enterprise-grade
solutions that companies are building on Node-RED today.

Our new **Certified Nodes** program we hope to elevate the community. We are
establishing a professional partnership with the most skilled node developers
and domain experts in the community.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **Expertise Recognition:** FlowFuse partners with developers who have
  demonstrated deep expertise in their domains, and may have already published
  nodes in their area of expertise. Ensuring our enterprise customers access the
  most knowledgeable contributors in each field.
- **Quality-Driven Selection:** Our certification process identifies nodes that
  excel in real-world environments, focusing on reliability, security,
  up-to-date documentation and professional implementation standards.
- **Comprehensive Solutions:** We welcome both open-source innovations and
  proprietary solutions. This approach allows experts to share their knowledge
  broadly while also providing targeted solutions for specific industry needs.

## What Does It Take to Become a Certified Publisher?

We are seeking partners who represent the pinnacle of expertise in their
respective domains. To join our certified ecosystem, we look for developers who
demonstrate:

- **Domain Expertise:** Deep knowledge and proven experience in the specific
  technology or industry vertical their nodes address
- **Professional Standards:** Commitment to enterprise-grade code quality,
  comprehensive testing, and security best practices
- **Continuous Innovation:** Ongoing development and enhancement of features
  that solve real-world enterprise challenges
- **Expert Support:** Ability to provide advanced technical support and guidance
  that goes beyond basic troubleshooting

Our certification process ensures that every node in the certified nodes
ecosystem meets these exacting standards. When enterprises choose certified
nodes, they gain access not just to code, but to the expertise and ongoing
support of recognized industry professionals. This creates a sustainable model
where expert knowledge is properly valued and enterprises receive the
reliability they require.

## Why Partner with FlowFuse?

Joining the FlowFuse Certified Nodes v2.0 program means becoming part of an
elite community of experts. Moreover, there's now a financial reward for doing
so. FlowFuse commits a fixed percentage of our FlowFuse Enterprise Platform Fee
to be distributed quarterly to the node authors.

If you are an expert developer or organization that has built exceptional
Node-RED nodes and are committed to maintaining the highest professional
standards, we want to collaborate with you. Let's work together to create a more
sustainable, professional ecosystem that connects enterprise users with the
industry's leading experts.
