  faq:
    - question: "How does this help my manufacturing operations?"
      answer: "Engineers spend less time writing code and more time optimizing processes. Parsing machine reports takes minutes instead of hours. Creating custom KPI dashboards no longer requires web developers. Documentation generates automatically for complex flows."
    - question: "What manufacturing equipment does it support?"
      answer: "Any equipment that outputs data. CNC machine reports, PLC logs, sensor readings, barcode scanners, vision systems. If your equipment produces text output, the AI can parse it. Works with Siemens, Allen-Bradley, FANUC, Mitsubishi—any brand."
    - question: "What's the learning curve for my team?"
      answer: "If your team can describe what they need in plain English, they can use it. No coding bootcamps. No JavaScript courses. Your process engineers who understand the equipment can generate the code they need."

Node-RED has transformed how manufacturing teams build automation. Its visual programming approach and extensive library of nodes handle most industrial requirements brilliantly. But every manufacturing process is unique, and sometimes you need custom JavaScript to implement your specific business logic or handle specialized equipment data.

<!--more-->

FlowFuse's AI Assistant bridges this gap. It generates the custom code your team needs from plain language descriptions. Here's how it works in practice.

## Where AI Assistant Adds Value

Node-RED's visual programming and rich ecosystem of nodes solve most automation challenges. But there are three areas where teams benefit from AI assistance to move even faster.

**Custom Code in Function Nodes:** Every plant has unique requirements. Whether it's parsing data from specialized equipment, implementing complex calculations specific to your process, or encoding business logic developed over years—these custom solutions require JavaScript in function nodes.

**Custom Dashboard Visualizations:** FlowFuse Dashboard's extensive widget library handles most visualization needs excellently. For those rare cases where you need something truly unique to your process—perhaps a specialized chart combining multiple data sources or matching exact corporate reporting standards—these require creating custom Vue.js templates.

**Understanding Complex Flows:** After years of continuous improvement, your Node-RED flows have grown. A temperature control system might span 200+ nodes across multiple tabs. When someone asks "what does this flow do?" or "where is the alarm logic?", finding answers takes hours of tracing connections and reading function nodes. New team members need weeks to understand systems that should take days.

## How AI Assistant Solves Each Challenge

The AI Assistant tackles all three problems with the same approach: describe what you need in plain language, get working code or documentation instantly. Let's see how this works for each challenge.

### Challenge 1: Function Node Code Generation

Consider this output from a CNC machine that's been reliable for 15 years:

```text
-- CYCLE END REPORT --
ID: M-45B / PART: XF-201
TIMESTAMP: 2025-07-09T14:22:01Z
SERIAL: 2025-0001547
OPERATOR: JONES, M
STATS ---
PART_COUNT: 481
CYCLE_TIME (S): 114.72
MAX_TEMP (C): 85.3
TOOL_WEAR_IDX: 0.73
COOLANT_LEVEL: OK
ALERTS: NONE
-- END --
```

The traditional approach means spending 30-60 minutes writing regex patterns, handling edge cases, and testing thoroughly. Your engineer needs to remember JavaScript string methods, debug regex syntax, and account for variations in the output format.

With AI Assistant, the process changes completely. Your engineer opens a function node, clicks the AI Assistant button, and types: "Parse this CNC report format. Extract PART_COUNT as integer, CYCLE_TIME as float, TOOL_WEAR_IDX as float, OPERATOR name, and ALERTS. Return as JSON." They paste the sample data and get working code in under two minutes:

```javascript
const text = msg.payload;
const partCount = text.match(/PART_COUNT:\s*(\d+)/)?.[1];
const cycleTime = text.match(/CYCLE_TIME \(S\):\s*([\d.]+)/)?.[1];
const toolWear = text.match(/TOOL_WEAR_IDX:\s*([\d.]+)/)?.[1];
const operator = text.match(/OPERATOR:\s*(.+)/)?.[1];
const alerts = text.match(/ALERTS:\s*(.+)/)?.[1];

msg.payload = {
    partCount: partCount ? parseInt(partCount) : null,
    cycleTime: cycleTime ? parseFloat(cycleTime) : null,
    toolWearIndex: toolWear ? parseFloat(toolWear) : null,
    operator: operator ? operator.trim() : null,
    alerts: alerts && alerts !== 'NONE' ? alerts.trim() : null,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
};

return msg;
```

The engineer reviews the code, tests it with their data, and moves on to solving actual manufacturing problems instead of wrestling with syntax.

### Challenge 2: Custom Dashboard Templates with Vue.js

FlowFuse Dashboard uses Vue.js for custom widgets. While powerful, this means engineers need to understand Vue component structure, reactive data binding, and integration with third-party libraries. Take the Pareto chart—fundamental for root cause analysis but not available as a standard widget.

Your quality engineer has defect data from the production line:

```javascript
{
  "scratches": 112,
  "misaligned_parts": 65,
  "paint_smudges": 23,
  "dents": 15,
  "incomplete_welds": 12,
  "wrong_components": 8,
  "other": 5
}
```

Without AI assistance, creating this widget means understanding Vue.js template syntax, writing data transformation methods, configuring Chart.js with dual axes, handling responsive sizing, and debugging reactive updates. That's easily 2-4 hours for someone unfamiliar with Vue.js.

The AI Assistant changes this completely. Your engineer describes: "Create a Pareto chart widget using Vue.js and Chart.js. Show defect types as bars sorted by frequency, with a cumulative percentage line. Include the 80% threshold line. Make it responsive and update when new data arrives."

The AI generates a complete Vue.js template component:
- Proper Vue structure with template, script, and style sections
- Reactive data handling for live updates
- Chart.js configuration with dual Y-axes
- Automatic sorting and percentage calculations
- Responsive sizing that works on all screens
- About 150 lines of production-ready code

### Challenge 3: Understanding Complex Flows

Your plastic extrusion line has been running perfectly for three years. The Node-RED flow controlling it has grown organically—200+ nodes across 8 tabs, dozens of function nodes with critical calculations, complex error handling developed through hard-won experience. Then your lead engineer announces retirement.

The new engineer faces a daunting task. Which nodes handle the critical temperature control? Where's the logic that prevents material waste during changeovers? How does the alarm cascade work? Traditional documentation is either outdated or non-existent.

The Flow Explainer transforms this situation. Select any flow or group of nodes, click "Explain," and receive comprehensive documentation in seconds. The AI analyzes node connections, reads function node code, identifies data flows between tabs, and generates clear, structured documentation.

The generated documentation includes the purpose of each major section, critical function nodes and their roles, data flow between different parts of the system, error handling and safety logic, and integration points with external systems. This turns tribal knowledge into accessible documentation that new team members can understand immediately.

## Capabilities and Boundaries

The AI Assistant excels at generating JavaScript for function nodes, creating Vue.js dashboard templates, and documenting complex flows. It handles common patterns reliably, significantly accelerating development.

However, it cannot debug existing code, create entire flows, or handle undocumented protocols. Complex algorithms and critical logic still require human expertise. Think of it as a coding assistant, not a replacement for engineering judgment.

Always review and test generated code before production use.

## Beyond AI: Smart Suggestions

FlowFuse is also developing Smart Suggestions—a pattern recognition feature that learns from common Node-RED workflows. As you build flows, it suggests which core node to add next based on typical usage patterns.

This complements the AI Assistant by speeding up routine flow construction.
