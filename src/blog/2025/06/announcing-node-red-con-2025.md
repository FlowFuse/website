At FlowFuse, our commitment to the Node-RED community is at the heart of everything we do. That's why we are thrilled to announce our support as a sponsor for **Node-RED Con 2025**, a free, online conference taking place on **Tuesday, November 4, 2025!**

This year's event is dedicated to exploring a vital theme: **Node-RED applications in industry**. It’s a fantastic opportunity for developers, engineers, and innovators to connect and share how Node-RED is being used to solve real-world challenges.

## The Agenda is Underway

The conference agenda is built from community submissions, and the Call for Papers received a great response. The organizing team reports receiving many excellent submissions, so we're in for some really interesting sessions.

The event will offer sessions in three different categories:

* **Full Talks & Demos (25-30 mins):** Focused on industrial use cases, IoT architectures, and edge computing.  
* **Lightning Talks (8-10 mins):** Showcasing fun, creative, or inspiring projects.  
* **Expert Panelists:** To discuss the future of industrial automation with Node-RED.

## Registration is Now Open
