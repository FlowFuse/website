Node-RED is a powerful tool for building automation and IoT projects. Its strength lies in its vibrant open-source community and the vast library of nodes that allow you to connect to almost anything. But for professional developers and system integrators, this vastness can present a challenge. How do you know which nodes are secure, reliable, and actively maintained? And for the talented developers building these nodes, how do you get rewarded for the countless hours spent creating and supporting them?

At FlowFuse, we believe that the creators of high-quality, dependable nodes deserve to be compensated for their expertise and effort. That's why we are thrilled to announce a revolutionary update to our ecosystem: **FlowFuse Certified Nodes v2.0**.

This isn't just an update; it's a new paradigm. For the first time, we are creating a direct financial link between the success of our enterprise customers and the developers who build the critical nodes they rely on.

## From Community Contribution to Paid Partnership

For too long, the Node-RED community has relied solely on the passion and goodwill of its developers. While this has fostered an incredible environment of collaboration, it's not a sustainable model for the enterprise-grade solutions that companies are building on Node-RED today.

Our new **Certified Node Publisher program** changes that. We are formalizing a system to financially reward you—the publishers of custom nodes and plugins—for your contributions.

Here’s how it works:

- **Share in Our Success:** FlowFuse will earmark a percentage of our enterprise revenue each month for distribution to our certified node publishers. Your success is now directly tied to ours.
- **Performance-Based Rewards:** The distribution isn't arbitrary. It's a merit-based system calculated on the real-world impact of your nodes. We'll look at the class of integration, the number of installations, and how actively your nodes are being used by our enterprise users.
- **Public and Private Nodes Welcome:** We understand that not all nodes are meant for public consumption. Our new program is designed to include both your open-source contributions and private, proprietary nodes. Now you can offer enterprise-specific solutions and get rewarded for them, all while we continue to support and maintain public nodes for the wider community.

## What Does It Take to Become a Certified Publisher?

We are looking for partners who are committed to quality and reliability. To be eligible for the rewards program, maintainers must commit to:

- **Active Maintenance:** Keep your nodes updated and squash bugs in a timely manner
- **Rock-Solid Security:** Proactively address any potential security vulnerabilities to protect our users
- **Rich Feature Set:** Continue to innovate and maintain the features that make your node great
- **Professional Support:** Provide Level 2 and Level 3 support for your nodes. Don't worry, our expert team at FlowFuse will handle all initial Level 1 support queries

If a maintainer is unable to uphold these standards, FlowFuse will step in to assume maintenance, guaranteeing that the nodes our customers depend on remain stable and secure. This ensures a win-win: developers are rewarded for their commitment, and users get the peace of mind that comes with a professionally supported and vetted node library.

## Why Partner with FlowFuse?

Joining the FlowFuse Certified Nodes v2.0 program means more than just a new revenue stream. It means:

- **Visibility:** Get your nodes in front of leading system integrators and enterprise clients who are looking for reliable solutions
- **Collaboration:** Become part of a collaborative ecosystem where your work is valued and supported by a dedicated partner
- **Focus on What You Do Best:** Let us handle the initial support and marketing, so you can focus on building incredible nodes
