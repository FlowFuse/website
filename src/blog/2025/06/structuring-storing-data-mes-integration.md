However, raw data alone isn't useful; it's just numbers. The real power of an MES comes from transforming this raw data into organized, useful insights. This means properly ordering, correcting, and storing data for easy access and use.

In this article, we'll explore the best ways to organize, shape, and save your factory data for your MES. We'll explain why this step is as important as data collection, discuss common methods, and show how FlowFuse turns basic factory data into something truly useful.

### Why Correctly Structuring, and Storing Data Matters for Your MES

Collecting factory data is only the first step. To really use this data well, you need to make sense of it. So, getting your factory data organized, structured, and stored in the right way is super important for your MES.

When your data is put in order and has a clear plan, your MES can quickly find what it needs. It can also understand the data easily and compare things correctly. This cleaning-up process also gets rid of mistakes and mixed-up information. This helps you trust the information your MES gives you, so you can make good decisions. Also, storing data in a smart way saves space and time, making it faster for your MES to grab the data. Simply put, when your factory data is sorted and saved correctly, it changes from just numbers into smart, helpful information. This makes your factory run smoother and work better.

## Core Strategies for Structuring Your Factory Data

Now that we understand the importance of data structuring, let's explore how to achieve it. This involves giving your data a clear shape and defining rules, ensuring that every system, such as your MES, can easily interpret the meaning of each piece of information.

Here are some straightforward ways we get data structred:

* **Making a Plan for Your Data (Data Models):** This is like drawing a simple map for your data. It helps you decide exactly what pieces of information you'll collect (like machine temperature, how many items are made, or who operated the machine) and how they connect to each other. This keeps everything neat and consistent. For example, a data model might say that every "production run" must have a "start time" and an "end time." This makes sure your MES always gets the full picture and avoids confusing or incomplete information.

* **Speaking the Same Language (Standardizing):** Imagine if everyone in your factory used different words for the same thing. It would be confusing! Standardizing means always using the same names, units, and formats everywhere. For example, if you measure temperature, always use Celsius. If one machine sends "TempC" and another just "Temperature," standardizing ensures both are read as "Temperature in Celsius." This prevents your MES from getting confused by different terms for the same data.

* **Adding the Full Story (Adding Context):** A raw number like "100" by itself doesn't tell you much. But if you add "100 items made by Machine A on June 10th at 2:00 PM in Batch 123," suddenly you know the whole story! This means attaching important details like the exact time, the machine's name, the batch number, or who was working at that moment. This extra information makes raw numbers meaningful, so your MES can track things accurately and you can make smarter decisions based on the full picture.

**Structuring Data Visually with FlowFuse**

FlowFuse simplifies data structuring with its intuitive, drag-and-drop environment. Raw machine data—often just numeric signals—can be enriched, formatted, and organized in real time, without writing any code.

You can easily:

- Add timestamps to readings  
- Associate data with specific machines or lines  
- Convert units (e.g., Fahrenheit to Celsius)  
- Rename fields for consistency  

FlowFuse includes standard nodes such as `split`, `change`, `join`, and `switch` that let you visually define how your data should be transformed. These nodes handle the technical details behind the scenes. You simply connect the building blocks to build a clean, structured flow of information.

With this approach, your factory team can transform raw machine signals into meaningful, standardized data—ready for your MES to consume.

## Where to Keep All That Factory Data

Once your factory data is nicely structured and contextualized, you need a safe and smart place to keep it. Different kinds of information often need different types of storage to be most useful.

Choosing the right storage ensures your data is easily accessible and performs well for your MES. Here are the main kinds of storage we typically use for factory data:

* **Time-Series Databases (TSDBs):** These are fantastic for data that changes constantly, like temperature readings from a sensor every few seconds, or how fast a machine is running. They're built to handle massive amounts of incoming updates and are perfect for spotting trends over time. Imagine them as a super-efficient diary that records every single moment. Good examples include **InfluxDB** and **TimescaleDB**.

* **Standard Databases (SQL Databases):** If you have structured information with clear connections, like production orders, how much material went into a batch, or results from quality checks, these are your go-to. They keep everything really neat and make sure pieces of information are correctly linked. Think of them like a well-organized spreadsheet or a library catalog. You'll often see **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** used here.

* **Data Lakes or Cloud Storage:** These are for when you have huge amounts of all sorts of data, even if it's not perfectly organized yet. You might use them for long-term historical records or for data you plan to analyze later using advanced tools. Picture them as a huge warehouse where you can store anything, ready for when you need to sort through it. **Amazon S3** and **Azure Data Lake Storage** are common examples.

When you're deciding where to store your data, you'll think about things like how much data you have and how fast it's coming in, how often you need to look at it (right now versus historical trends), what it will cost, and if it can grow with your factory. You'll also consider how well it connects with your other systems and how you'll keep the data safe.

**FlowFuse also Helps with Data Storage**

FlowFuse also shines here, as it isn't only for contextualizing and transforming data; it also ensures that data lands in the right place to be stored. 

FlowFuse has many nodesfor almost every database and cloud storage system you'll find in a modern factory. This includes direct connections for regular databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL for your organized production data. It also has special nodes for time-series databases like InfluxDB and TimescaleDB to handle fast-moving sensor and machine data. Plus, FlowFuse connects strongly to big Data Lakes and Cloud Storage services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Microsoft Azure.

## Making Sure Your Data is Trustworthy

You've got your factory data flowing, organized, and stored. That's a huge step! But there's one more important thing: is your data reliable? Even if it's perfectly structured and has all the right details, wrong numbers can cause big problems. If machines send bad information, or if pieces of data go missing, your MES will make poor decisions. This can lead to expensive mistakes, wasted materials, and unwanted delays.

Good, reliable data means it's:

* **Accurate:** What it says is really happening.
* **Complete:** All the info you need is there.
* **Consistent:** It makes sense everywhere.
* **Timely:** It arrives when you need it.
* **Valid:** It just looks right.

**FlowFuse Helps to Ensure Data is trustworthy**

FlowFuse also helps here by letting you set up quick checks on your data as it arrives. You can tell FlowFuse to ignore numbers that are clearly wrong, like a machine temperature of "100 million degrees" or "-1000 degrees." These numbers are outside a normal, valid range. FlowFuse has some nodes that let you define rules for your data. You can set up what numbers are allowed, what kind of data should be there (like text or numbers), and what details it must include. (Examples of such nodes include [node-red-contrib-full-msg-json-schema-validation](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-full-msg-json-schema-validation) and [node-red-contrib-json-schema](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-json-schema)). FlowFuse can also send alerts to tell people when important details are missing, for example, by email or Telegram. These checks happen *before* any data goes to your MES or into storage. This way, your MES always works with good, reliable information.

## How All Your Factory Data Works Together

Now that your factory data is gathered, organized, and stored, let's see how it all connects to make your **MES** really shine in your factory.

It all starts on the shop floor with your machines, sensors, and controllers creating raw information. This is where **FlowFuse** steps in.

* **Data Collection & Preparation:** FlowFuse runs near your equipment, connecting to all your machines. It quickly grabs this raw data, cleans it up, and adds important details like the time and which machine sent it. This turns raw numbers into useful information.
*  **Data Routing:** FlowFuse then allows you to send this prepared data to the best storage spot, whether it is a **Standard Database** (like SQL), a **Time-Series Database**, or a **Data Lake/Cloud Storage**.

Once the data is in these organized places, your **MES** can easily use it. Instead of dealing with messy raw signals, your MES connects directly to these clean databases. It pulls exactly the information it needs, when it needs it.

**FlowFuse makes it easy to build dashboards and industrial applications**

FlowFuse doesn't stop at managing your data; it also helps you build the user interface (UI) for your MES. You can create dashboards and industrial applications with clear visuals and controls. This is all done with no-code, just by dragging and dropping ready-made pieces. FlowFuse offers a collection of special visual tools, called ["FlowFuse Dashboard"](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com), that make this easy. These tools let you design the screens your operators use to see information and control processes.

## Final Thought

Your factory's success hinges on smart decisions, and smart decisions need good data. It's not enough to just collect information from your machines; you need to make sense of it.

That means organizing your data so it's clear and consistent. Think of it like putting all your tools in the right place – easy to find when you need them. You also need to clean up the data, getting rid of errors so you can trust what you see. Finally, you need to store it smartly, choosing the best spot for different types of information so it's always ready for use.

FlowFuse helps with all of this. It's like your data's personal assistant, collecting raw information, tidying it up, and sending it to the right storage, all without complicated coding. This ensures your Manufacturing Execution System (MES) gets the accurate, reliable data it needs to help you run your factory smoother and make better choices.
