Our three focal points for the latest release of FlowFuse have been:

- **Collaborative Development:** Our new **Custom Node Catalogues** provides a place for you to centralise your own private nodes and Javascript libraries for Node-RED.
- **Full Stack Applications:** We've added our new **"Smart Schema Suggestions"** feature for automatically generating documentation for your MQTT Brokers.
- **DevOps:** We've improved Pipelines now to let you deploy to Device Groups in the middle of a Pipeline, this is just the first step in a wider set of improvements to come for DevOps Pipelines.

## Git Integration

This has been one of those features that has come up a number of times with our users; we knew we wanted to have Git integration in the platform, but we also wanted it to fit in a natural way with the developer workflows we provide.

With this release, you can now add a Git Repository stage to your deployment pipelines. When the pipeline is triggered, the latest snapshot will get pushed to the configured repository.

This is very much a "first-iteration" of the feature that will allow us to get feedback early and continue to iterate.

With this release, the following restrictions apply:

 - Only GitHub.com hosted repostories are supported
 - Users must create a GitHub Personal Access Token and add to their Team Settings
 - We currently only support pushing snapshots to a Git repository

This last point is important; this release lets you backup your flows to git, but we haven't yet enabled the return journey of pulling a snapshot from a Git repository back to your Node-RED instance. That'll come in the near future and will unlock a full git-based review workflow within the pipelines.

We'll also look at enabling other Git hosting providers - let us know which you'd like to see on the list.

This feature is available to Team and Enterprise teams on FlowFuse Cloud and self-hosted customers.

## Better Node-RED log handling

We've improved the log handling within our Hosted Node-RED instances. Previously we were using a fix sized buffer in memory; meaning the noiser your Node-RED instance was, the less history you'd have. The UI for browsing the logs was also awkward when you wanted to jump back to an earlier section of the logs.

With this release, once you update your instances to the latest version, we will
now store the last 7 days worth of logs for each hosted Node-RED instance.

To go along side this, we've added the ability to jump to a specific time/date in the logs without having to endlessly scroll.

To start benefiting from the extended logs, make sure you update the latest version via your Instance Settings page.

## Remote Instance Provisioning

We've updated the provisioning token support to allow you to automatically assign your remote instances to an application within your team.

The option to assign to a hosted instance is still there, but being able to assign to the appilcation is more generally useful for most workflows on the platform.

Details available in the [changelog](https://flowfuse.com/changelog/2025/04/device-provisioning/).

## Local Login for Remote Instances

One of the great features of our Remote Instance management is that we enable secure remote access to the Node-RED editor through the platform. To date, this approach has meant we disable direct local access to the editor.

With the most recent Device Agent release, we've added the ability to configure a local user login for the editor. This can be used when the remote instance is not able to reach the FlowFuse platform.

We're keen for feedback on this and will continue to explore otherwise to provide secure local access to the remote instance.

## Resource Alerts

We expanded the notficiations we send to help you track the health of your Node-RED instances. We will now send notifications if the CPU and/or memory usages exceeds 75% of the available capacity for a prolonged time.

You can further opt-in or out of these notifications via the instance settings.

Details available in the [changelog](https://flowfuse.com/changelog/2025/03/resource-notifications/)

## Changes to tags for `flowfuse/node-red` containers

For kubernetes and docker environments, we've updated the base container our `latest` tag points at to ensure
it defaults to the latest Node.js and Node-RED versions.
