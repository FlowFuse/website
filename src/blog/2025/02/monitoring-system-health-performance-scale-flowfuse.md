Edge devices are everywhere, and their numbers are skyrocketing—from 2.7 billion in 2020 to a projected 7.8 billion by 2030, according to [various reports](https://transformainsights.com/news/edge-computing-rapid-growth-iot#:~:text=New%20Transforma%20Insights%20reports%20covering,edge%20capabilities%20in%20IoT%20devices.). That is a massive leap, highlighting their growing role in IoT and industrial automation.

These edge devices are essential for automation, data processing, and connectivity. As their numbers grow, so does the need to monitor their health. Tracking key metrics like CPU usage, memory, and system performance helps ensure they run efficiently and remain reliable. Early detection of potential issues allows for timely intervention, preventing disruptions and optimizing performance.

## What Exactly Does Monitoring Device Health Mean, and Why Is It Essential?

Monitoring device health involves tracking various metrics to ensure they run efficiently. While many factors can be monitored, the most common and essential ones include CPU usage, memory, system uptime, and system load. These help identify potential issues early, preventing crashes or unexpected downtime.

Edge devices are key in communication, data processing, and system integration in IoT and industrial settings. If these devices experience high CPU usage or low memory, they can slow down automation, disrupt data flow, and reduce overall efficiency. For example, in manufacturing, edge devices with tools like FlowFuse help connect older machines to modern cloud systems, collect and transform data, and integrate with other platforms. If these devices fail, real-time data flow can be interrupted, affecting decision-making and production.

Regular monitoring helps catch small issues before they turn into major problems. This proactive approach keeps devices running smoothly, reduces downtime, and ensures they perform reliably in any environment.

## Getting Started with Monitoring Devices

In this section, you will learn how to retrieve key system metrics—CPU usage, memory usage, and more—using Node-RED. While testing on thousands of devices would be ideal, it is not practical here. Instead, we will demonstrate the process using a Raspberry Pi, a Windows machine, and a macOS device.

We will begin by monitoring a single device (Raspberry Pi), collecting its data, and sending it to a hosted Node-RED instance for visualization in the FlowFuse dashboard. This step-by-step approach will help you understand how to retrieve these metrics before scaling up. Once you have learned the process and set it up, we will expand it to monitor multiple devices efficiently—just as FlowFuse enables customers to do at scale.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Running Node-RED Instance  
You need a running Node-RED instance on the device you want to monitor. The easiest way to set this up is with the [FlowFuse Device Agent](/product/device-agent/), which provides secure remote access, real-time collaboration, snapshots for quick recovery, DevOps tools, and device group management. With it, you can push updates to multiple devices with a single click.  

For a step-by-step installation guide, refer to the [FlowFuse Device Agent Quickstart](/docs/device-agent/quickstart/).  

If you haven’t yet signed up for a FlowFuse account, [sign up now](https://app.flowfuse.com/account/create/).

2. Required Node-RED Nodes  
To collect system data and display it on a dashboard, install the following Node-RED nodes:  

- `node-red-contrib-os`: Retrieves system information such as memory, uptime, and load.
- `node-red-contrib-cpu`: Monitors CPU usage.
- `@flowfuse/node-red-dashboard`: Provides UI components for visualizing system metrics.
- `node-red-contrib-moment`: Formats uptime duration in a human-readable format.

You can install these nodes from the [Node-RED Palette Manager](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/palette/manager).

### Collecting CPU and System Metrics with Node-RED  

Now that Node-RED is running on your device, it’s time to gather essential system metrics. Monitoring CPU usage, memory consumption, system uptime, and load averages helps you monitormonitor performance and spot potential issues before they become serious problems.  

Let’s break it down step by step.  

#### Collecting CPU Usage Data  

To start, let’s capture CPU usage in real time:  

1. Drag a CPU node from the Performance category onto the canvas.  
2. Double-click the node and uncheck all options except "Send a message for overall usage." This ensures you get a clear view of total CPU performance. If you need per-core metrics, you can enable the other options.  
3. Add an Inject node, double-click it, and set it to trigger at a suitable interval (e.g., every second, every 10 seconds, or every 30 seconds). Connect its output to the CPU node.  
4. Add a Debug node and connect it to the output of the CPU node. This lets you view CPU data in the debug pane.  
5. Click Deploy in the top-right corner of the Node-RED editor.  

Your debug pane will now start showing live CPU usage data.  

#### Monitoring Memory Usage  

Next, let’s track memory consumption:  

1. Drag a Memory node onto the canvas and double-click it.  
2. Choose the unit for memory display (e.g., gigabytes for easier readability).  
3. Connect the Memory node’s input to the Inject node’s output.  
4. Connect the Memory node’s output to the existing Debug node.  
5. Click Deploy to start monitoring.  

Once deployed, you will see a structured object in the debug pane containing along with cpu usage:  

- totalmem: Total available memory  
- freemem: Free memory  
- memusage: Current memory usage  

#### Tracking System Uptime  

Monitoring uptime helps detect unexpected reboots and ensures system stability.  

1. Drag an Uptime node onto the canvas.  
2. Connect its input to the Inject node’s output.  
3. Connect its output to the Debug node.  
4. Click Deploy to activate uptime tracking.  

Each time the Inject node triggers, the debug pane will display the uptime in seconds and CPU and memory usage. 

#### Analyzing Load Average  

To understand how busy your system has been over time, let’s analyze the load average:  

1. Drag a Loadavg node onto the canvas.  
2. Connect its input to the Inject node’s output.  
3. Connect its output to the Debug node.  
4. Click Deploy to start tracking.  

This will give you three key metrics:  

- 1-minute load average: Immediate system load  
- 5-minute load average: Recent short-term trend  
- 15-minute load average: Long-term system trend  

If these values remain consistently high, your system may struggle under excessive demand, signaling a need for optimization or additional processing power.  

With these metrics in place, you have a solid foundation for real-time system monitoring.   

### Sharing Data Across Different Node-RED Instances

Once we have the data, we must send it to the Node-RED instance handling visualization. Keeping the dashboard separate is essential for scalability. As the number of devices increases, a dedicated instance ensures we can monitor all of them from a single, centralized dashboard. This approach also makes management more efficient.

Before sending the data, we combine all collected metrics into a single object for better organization and easier processing. Currently, each node sends its metrics as a separate message object. Merging them into a single object streamlines data handling and reduces message overhead.

Import the following flow and deploy it in the device instance. While I am not covering the step-by-step process here, the explanation below covers what the flow includes and how it works.

{% endrenderFlow %}

Let's understand the flow.

In the flow above, four Change nodes are used, each connected to the output of the CPU, Memory, Uptime, and Loadavg nodes. As mentioned earlier, these nodes provide their data separately as `msg.payload`. We use Change nodes to modify the message structure before sending the data to ensure a more structured and organized format.  

Next, a Join node merges the `msg.data` objects from all Change nodes into a single data object. After that, another Change node assigns this combined object to `msg.payload`.  

The final combined object appears as shown in the image below:

![Combined object containing system data such as CPU usage, memory usage, uptime, and load average.](./images/combine-object.png){data-zoomable}
_Combined object containing system data such as CPU usage, memory usage, uptime, and load average._

To share this data with other Node-RED instances, we use the Project Out node, which is only available in FlowFuse. It works similarly to MQTT, using MQTT in the background but without requiring manual configuration—just a topic name and the target instance.

The [Project nodes](/blog/2024/10/exploring-flowfuse-project-nodes/) make it easy to manage communication and connection between Node-RED instances.

In this Project node, we broadcast the message across all instances in the team using `${FF_DEVICE_NAME}` as the topic—an environment variable automatically created in all FlowFuse instances. 

![Image showing the environment variables of Raspberry Pi devices with their values.](./images/env.png){data-zoomable}
_Image showing the environment variables of Raspberry Pi devices with their values._

Using environment variables as the topic enables the same flow to be used across multiple devices without modification, ensuring that each device utilizes its own environment variables (device name) and sends data under its respective topic.

## Visualizing Data with the FlowFuse Dashboard  

Now that the data is being broadcasted, it can be used to build a simple dashboard that visualizes it with different types of charts.  

Ensure that a separate hosted instance has been created in the same team where the device is registered. This instance will be used to deploy the dashboard.

## Scaling Device Monitoring with FlowFuse

Now that we have learned how to monitor a single device, built a flow to gather system data, and created a dashboard to visualize those metrics, the real challenge arises when scaling up to thousands or even tens of thousands of devices. Manually creating a system data-gathering flow for each device would be impractical. However, FlowFuse can automate this process in less than five minutes. Let's see how.

### Creating Device Group

1. Navigate to the FlowFuse platform and go to the Application where your devices are and where you want to create a group. Ensure that all the devices you want to monitor are part of this application.

1. Click on "Device Groups" from the top menu. Next, click on the "Add Device Group" button. In the newly opened window, enter a group name and description, then click "Create".

4. Next, in the left-side container, you will see a list of all available devices in your application. Select the devices you want to add to the group (make sure to add only the devices that require the deployment of the flow built to gather system metrics). Click the "Add Devices" button at the top-right of that container, and then click "Save Changes". Once done, you will see all added devices in the right-side container, confirming that they have been successfully added to the group.

### Creating Snapshot

1. Navigate to the Remote Instance on which we developed the flow to monitor performance. Switch to "Version History" by clicking on "Version History" from the top.

2. Go to the Snapshots tab and create a new snapshot by clicking the "Create Snapshot" button. Enter details such as the name and description. While making the snapshot, ensure the "Set as Target" option is checked before clicking "Create". Enabling this option sets the created snapshot as the device’s active snapshot. Later, this snapshot will be used for deployment on devices within the device group via the DevOps pipeline.

### Creating a DevOps Pipeline  

1. Navigate to the application where the devices were added and the device group was created. Switch to the "Pipelines" tab at the top, then click "Add Pipeline". In the newly opened window, enter a pipeline name.  

![Image showing the 'Add Pipeline' button.](./images/add-pipeline-button.png){data-zoomable}

2. In the newly added pipeline, click "Add Stage".  

![Image showing the button to add a stage.](./images/adding-stage-button.png){data-zoomable}  
_Image showing the button to add a stage._  

1. In the newly opened window, select "Remote Instance" as the stage type, enter a stage name, and select the device where the flow was previously built for a single device. Under "Action," select "Use active snapshot" and click "Add Stage".

4. To add another stage, select "Device Group" as the stage type, enter a stage name, choose the previously created device group, and click "Add Stage."

5. Before moving further, ensure all devices are in fleet mode.

7. Once both stages are added, click the 'Run Pipeline' button for the first stage. Running the pipeline will deploy the active snapshot to the devices in the device group, including all settings, environment variables, and flows of that instance. Whether the device group has two devices or thousands, the deployment will be completed efficiently and quickly.

Now, you have the system data of all devices broadcasted on the topic and the device name. To monitor each device, go to the dashboard instance, copy the flow, and create copies for each device. Ensure that you replace the topic with the corresponding device name. Additionally, create a separate page for each device, assign them to separate groups, and correctly move all copied widgets into the appropriate groups. Alternatively, follow [these steps](#visualizing-data-with-the-flowfuse-dashboard) again for each device, and you will have a centralized dashboard monitoring thousands of devices live.

## Conclusion

Building a monitoring flow in Node-RED is simple. It allows you to track key system metrics like CPU usage, memory, and uptime with minimal effort. Its low-code Interface makes it easy to create and deploy monitoring solutions quickly.

However, manually deploying this monitoring flow across 10,000 or even 100,000 devices can be a complex and time-consuming task. This is where FlowFuse makes a difference. With features like Device Groups and DevOps pipelines, you can deploy your application from a single device or hosted Node-RED instance to thousands of devices with just a single click. FlowFuse also provides powerful tools for scaling, managing, and monitoring industrial operations, making large-scale deployments more efficient and hassle-free.
