Iterative development is a core principle in software development, where methodologies like Agile, Scrum, and Kanban emphasize continuous, incremental progress. This approach allows software products to evolve through repeated cycles, each delivering minor, manageable updates. Developers can gather user feedback, make adjustments, and improve the product over time, ensuring it remains aligned with changing requirements and user needs.

For decades, manufacturing has relied on more linear and sequential process where each production phase is completed before the next begins. The idea is that you fully design and plan a product, finalize all specifications, and only then move on to building and testing. This means much upfront investment in resources, time, and money. If a problem arises late in the process—say, during full-scale production—fixing it can be costly and time-consuming.

This linear process made sense when the industry relied on mass production techniques, and economies of scale and fixed designs ruled the day. Once a product is designed and production begins, manufacturers would ideally produce large quantities without many changes. The process was designed for efficiency and minimizing variability. However, this approach is inherently slow to adapt. It doesn't account for changes in market demand, evolving consumer preferences, or unforeseen technical issues. 

That’s why the shift to iterative development is a challenging yet necessary evolution for the manufacturing sector. In this article, we will take a closer look at what iterative development is, the challenges manufacturers face in adopting it, and how today's manufacturing is navigating this transformation through emerging technologies.

## What Exactly is Iterative Development?

**Planning → Designing → Implementation → Testing → Gathering Feedback**

Iterative development is a dynamic approach to product creation that focuses on incremental progress through repeated cycles, or iterations. The cycle typically starts with planning, where goals and priorities are set for the iteration. In the design phase, the team conceptualizes the next set of features or changes to be implemented. These are then built into a working version of the product. Once built, the product is tested to gather feedback—whether it’s from users, stakeholders, or internal testing. Based on this feedback, the product is then refined, addressing issues, optimizing performance, and enhancing features.

Each iteration allows for quick adjustments, reducing the risks associated with traditional "big bang" development. The result is a product that is continuously improved based on real-world feedback, with each iteration aligning more closely with customer needs and market demands.

## Why Software Embraces Iterative Development

The software development industry, in contrast, operates in a digital environment that allows for much greater flexibility and rapid changes. Software code can be written, tested, and deployed quickly, and bugs can be fixed instantly. As a result, the software development process has evolved into a highly iterative one. For example, in **Agile** development, products are developed in small, manageable increments, called **sprints**, each lasting a few weeks. At the end of each sprint, a usable version of the product is delivered, and feedback is gathered. The development team then revises the product based on user feedback or new requirements. 

This ability to make rapid changes is a significant advantage in an industry where customer needs can change quickly, and technological advancements happen fast. The quicker a software product can evolve in response to these changes, the more successful it becomes. Because of this flexibility, software development has fully embraced iterative, feedback-driven models that promote continuous improvement. At **FlowFuse**, we adopt this philosophy, where constant feedback and improvement are fundamental to delivering high-quality, adaptive products.

## Challenges of Adopting Iterative Development in Manufacturing

Manufacturing, unlike software, is deeply tied to physical processes, which makes adopting iterative development more complex. Once a production line is set up, changes come at a significant cost. The process typically involves heavy upfront investments in machinery, tooling, labor, and materials. If a change is needed during or after production, it may require retooling the entire system, which can be expensive and time-consuming. These challenges are compounded by the physical nature of products, where altering designs or features often means modifying tangible components—machinery, supply chains, and materials—each of which requires careful planning and significant resources. Unlike software, where adjustments can be made in minutes by tweaking code, these physical changes are far from instantaneous and often take weeks or months to implement.

Additionally, in many manufacturing processes, batch production is the norm. Once a batch is produced, modifying the design or features without affecting the entire batch is difficult. If a new model or design needs to be introduced, it could require scrapping or reworking previously produced units, adding to the cost and complexity. This batch model, common in industries like automotive and electronics, creates rigid constraints on change and slows down the iteration process. Regulatory and compliance constraints also limit the ability to iterate quickly. Industries like healthcare, aerospace, and automotive are heavily regulated, and any change in design often requires re-certification or new safety tests. Rapid iteration is hindered by these regulatory requirements, which require time to ensure that new product versions meet all necessary standards. This can significantly delay the process of testing, certifying, and releasing new versions of a product.

The integration of IT and OT systems also presents a challenge. Many manufacturing facilities still operate with a divide between IT (digital design and planning) and OT (physical production on the factory floor) systems. To adopt iterative development, manufacturers need seamless communication between these systems, but legacy OT systems often don't integrate easily with newer IT tools. Bridging this gap requires a significant investment in technology and can take considerable time to implement, delaying the transition to an agile production model.

The slower feedback loop in manufacturing also hinders the rapid changes that iterative development promotes. In software, developers can receive near-instant feedback through analytics, surveys, or user testing. In contrast, manufacturers often have to wait until after a product has been produced and delivered to customers before gathering feedback. By then, significant time and resources have already been invested, making quick adjustments difficult. Furthermore, any changes made at this stage usually involve revising physical products, which is a much slower and more costly process than altering a digital prototype.

With all these challenges, there is also a common myth that iterative development is not something that can or should be implemented in manufacturing. Many in the industry believe that the physical nature of production processes and the complexity of managing resources, machinery, and compliance requirements make it impossible to adopt such a flexible and dynamic approach. There's a prevailing mindset that manufacturing must adhere to linear processes due to the large upfront investments and the scale of production. However, this view overlooks the potential for transformation through modern technologies and innovative methodologies.

## The Shift Towards Iterative Development in Manufacturing

Despite the challenges, iterative development is becoming increasingly feasible in manufacturing, especially with the advent of emerging technologies that challenge the longstanding myths surrounding production processes.

One key enabler is 3D printing (additive manufacturing), which allows manufacturers to produce prototypes and small-batch parts without the need for costly molds or custom tools. This significantly reduces the financial barrier to rapid iteration, enabling designers to test new ideas quickly and affordably. Contrary to the belief that iteration is impossible in manufacturing due to the high upfront cost of tooling, 3D printing demonstrates how agile production can be achieved even in industries traditionally bound by rigid processes.

Moreover, modular production systems offer flexible production lines that can be easily reconfigured to produce different product versions with minimal investment in new machinery. This flexibility reduces the cost and time typically associated with making frequent design changes, further supporting the case for iterative development. This debunks the myth that manufacturing requires a linear process with large, inflexible investments for each product variant.

Another significant advancement is the use of digital twins—virtual replicas of products, systems, or processes. Digital twins allow manufacturers to simulate and test design changes in a virtual environment before physical implementation. This virtual testing not only saves time but also helps identify and mitigate potential issues early, minimizing costly physical adjustments. By implementing digital twins, manufacturers can iterate on designs and processes in a controlled, risk-free environment, breaking the perception that only physical trial-and-error can lead to valid product changes.

Furthermore, Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) are tackling the rigid constraints imposed by traditional batch production. FMS enables manufacturers to produce small quantities of different products on the same production line, reducing downtime and allowing for design iteration without halting production. With this capability, manufacturers gain the agility to quickly switch between products and adjust processes, empowering them to respond faster to market demands. FMS challenges the traditional view that batch production, by its nature, prevents flexible changes to product designs.

The adoption of technologies like [MQTT](/blog/2024/10/announcement-mqtt-broker/) and architectures like [Unified Namespace (UNS)](/solutions/uns/) is changing how devices and systems communicate on the factory floor. MQTT allows quick, efficient data sharing between devices, improving monitoring and control. This makes it easier to adjust processes and track product performance. UNS connects IT and OT by providing a centralized system for smooth communication across the production environment. Platforms like FlowFuse simplify the implementation of UNS, helping collect data from both old and new parts of the floor.

### The Toyota Example: Iterative Development in Action

A well-established example of iterative development in manufacturing is the **Toyota Production System (TPS)**, which incorporates continuous, incremental improvements through the philosophy of [Kaizen](https://mag.toyota.co.uk/kaizen-toyota-production-system/). Unlike the traditional, rigid manufacturing process, Toyota has embraced iterative improvements as a core part of its operations. This approach allows the company to continuously optimize its manufacturing processes while keeping costs down and ensuring high product quality.

**Kaizen**, which means "change for the better," involves making small but regular changes to production lines, workflows, and designs. Every worker, from assembly line operators to top managers, is encouraged to identify inefficiencies or quality issues and propose solutions. These improvements, although small on their own, accumulate over time and result in significant gains in efficiency, cost reduction, and product quality.

A concrete example of this iterative process is Toyota's use of the **Andon Cord** on its assembly lines. If workers notice a defect or problem during production, they can pull the Andon Cord to halt production. This immediate feedback loop ensures the issue is resolved quickly rather than allowing it to snowball into a bigger problem. This rapid intervention and continuous improvement cycle mirrors iterative development practices seen in software development.

In addition to Kaizen, Toyota has also utilized **just-in-time production (JIT)** and **Jidoka** (automation with a human touch) to create a system that allows for rapid adjustments without compromising quality or efficiency. These practices allow Toyota to iteratively improve products and the processes and systems that produce them. This ongoing, iterative feedback and adaptation make Toyota a leader in operational efficiency and product innovation.

## Approach Manufacturers Can Take to Adapt Iterative Development

Adopting iterative development in manufacturing doesn’t have to mean completely changing everything at once. Start small with pilot projects—test agile methods on one product line or part of your process. This lets you experiment without disrupting the whole operation, and it helps you see where things are working or need improvement. Once you’ve learned from these smaller tests, you can slowly expand agile practices to other parts of the business.

One key to making iterative development work is using the right technologies. For example, 3D printing allows manufacturers to quickly create and test prototypes. This means you can try out new designs without spending too much on tools or molds. **Digital twins**, which are virtual copies of real-world systems, let you test product changes digitally before making them in the real world. This saves both time and money by catching problems early. These technologies make it easier to make quick changes and learn as you go, without big costs.

However, the real value of iterative development is in creating a mindset of continuous improvement. Manufacturers need to focus on getting feedback constantly—whether from teams within the company, customers, or suppliers. Having a system that lets you gather feedback quickly helps you respond to changes in the market or customer needs. The faster you can adapt, the more likely you are to stay ahead of competitors. Real-time feedback helps manufacturers spot issues early, improve products faster, and reduce risk.

The same agile thinking can be applied throughout the entire supply chain. For instance, an agile supply chain allows manufacturers to adjust quickly when there are changes in demand or supply chain issues. Modular designs also make it easier to improve individual parts of a product without having to change the whole product. This helps manufacturers keep things moving smoothly and respond quickly to changes.

Lastly, adopting iterative development is not just about tools or processes—it’s about changing the culture within the company. **Training your teams** on agile methods and encouraging collaboration at every level will create a culture of continuous improvement. When everyone in the company—from the design team to the production floor—feels responsible for making things better, the company can respond more quickly to challenges. This proactive mindset helps you fix problems before they become bigger issues and creates a more adaptable, innovative company.

In short, manufacturers don’t need to do everything at once. Start small, invest in the right technologies, and create a culture of feedback and improvement. Over time, this will lead to **greater efficiency, better innovation, and more flexibility**, giving you a competitive edge in an ever-changing market.

## Conclusion

The shift to iterative development in manufacturing, as explored in this blog, demonstrates that while the challenges are significant, they are not insurmountable. For decades, the manufacturing sector has relied on linear, rigid processes due to the high upfront investments and the complexity of physical production. This mindset, driven by the perceived difficulty of incorporating iterative, flexible approaches, has created a myth that agile methodologies like those used in software development are not feasible in manufacturing environments.

However, as we’ve seen, emerging technologies such as 3D printing, digital twins, and modular production systems are breaking down these barriers, proving that iterative development is not only possible but also advantageous. Manufacturers are beginning to realize that adopting agile practices can lead to faster innovation, better product quality, and a more adaptable production environment—ultimately changing the landscape of manufacturing.

The myths around the inability to iterate quickly in manufacturing stem from an outdated perspective that doesn't account for the evolving technological capabilities and the need for more agile, responsive production processes. As manufacturers embrace these new technologies and shift their mindset towards continuous improvement, they will find that iterative development can offer significant benefits—just as it has in the software industry. The journey may be complex, but with the right tools, technologies, and mindset, manufacturing can evolve to become more agile, efficient, and responsive to market demands.
