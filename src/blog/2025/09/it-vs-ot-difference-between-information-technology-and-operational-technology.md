If you run a manufacturing operation, you work with two distinct types of technology systems every day. Most manufacturers don't realize how much this separation costs them in missed opportunities, inefficiencies, and reactive decision-making.

Understanding the difference between these systems and how to connect them can save you money, prevent costly mistakes, and help you make smarter decisions about your plant's future.

## What is IT?

IT handles your business information. This includes your accounting software, email, employee databases, customer records, and inventory systems. IT systems help you run the business side of manufacturing.

Your IT department manages computers, servers, and software that store and process company data. When you check production reports, look up customer orders, or send emails, you're using IT systems. These systems are built to share information across your company and connect to the internet.

Most IT systems get updated regularly with new software versions and security patches. They're designed to be flexible and can usually handle some downtime for maintenance or updates.

## What is OT?

OT controls your actual manufacturing equipment. This includes the systems that run your production lines, control your machines, monitor temperatures, and manage your facility's power and safety systems.

OT systems make things happen on your factory floor. When a sensor detects a problem and stops a machine, that's OT working. When your production line speeds up or slows down based on demand, that's OT controlling the process.

Unlike IT systems, many OT systems weren't built to connect to networks. They're designed to run the same way for years without changes because stopping production to update software costs money. Reliability matters more than having the latest features.

## Why the Difference Matters

Here's the key: IT manages information about your business, while OT controls your actual production.

This creates real challenges. Your IT team focuses on keeping data secure and systems connected. Your OT team focuses on keeping production running safely and efficiently. They have different priorities, different skills, and different approaches to problems.

When IT systems go down, people can't access files or send emails. Frustrating, but usually not catastrophic. When OT systems fail, production stops, and every minute of downtime costs real money.

## Connecting IT and OT: The Smart Move

More manufacturers are connecting their IT and OT systems, and the reasons are compelling. When production machines can share data with business systems, you get better visibility into what's actually happening on your factory floor.

For example, if your production equipment automatically reports when it's running low on materials, your purchasing system can reorder supplies before you run out. If machine sensors detect early signs of wear, your maintenance system can schedule repairs before something breaks and shuts down the line.

This connection gives you real-time data about production, quality, energy usage, and equipment health. You can spot problems faster, plan maintenance better, and make smarter decisions about production schedules.

## The Challenges Are Real

Connecting IT and OT isn't simple. Manufacturing facilities are filled with equipment from dozens of different vendors, each speaking its own language. Your conveyor system might use Modbus, your CNC machines communicate via Ethernet/IP, your sensors use Profibus, and your packaging equipment relies on DeviceNet. Getting all these different protocols to work together requires significant technical expertise and integration effort.

The IT landscape adds another layer of complexity. Your ERP system might be SAP, your quality management runs on a different platform, your maintenance system uses yet another database, and your inventory tracking relies on custom spreadsheets. Each system has its own data format, update schedule, and integration requirements, making seamless data flow a major challenge.

This technical complexity is compounded by organizational challenges. Your IT and OT teams often have fundamentally different priorities that can create friction. IT teams focus on security, standardization, and keeping business systems running smoothly. OT teams prioritize reliability, safety, and avoiding any changes that might disrupt production. When IT suggests network upgrades, OT worries about downtime. When OT wants to keep using proven systems, IT worries about security vulnerabilities.

Legacy equipment creates additional obstacles. That perfectly reliable machine from 2008 might not have Ethernet connectivity, cloud compatibility, or any way to share data with modern systems. The cost of retrofitting or replacing working equipment just for connectivity often outweighs the immediate benefits, creating difficult investment decisions.

Perhaps most critically, security becomes exponentially more complex when you connect production systems to business networks. A cyber attack that disrupts email is inconvenient, but one that shuts down your production line, compromises safety systems, or steals proprietary manufacturing data can be catastrophic for your business.

## Your Strategic Path Forward

The convergence of IT and OT represents an inevitable evolution rather than an optional upgrade. While IT systems continue advancing business intelligence and enterprise connectivity, OT systems are increasingly incorporating edge computing, artificial intelligence, and cloud integration capabilities.

The competitive advantage belongs to manufacturers who can strategically align these technologies to create intelligent, responsive operations. This requires moving beyond simple data collection toward sophisticated analytics that drive autonomous decision-making, predictive optimization, and adaptive manufacturing processes.

Success demands a methodical approach: establish clear business objectives, prioritize use cases with measurable ROI, design robust security architectures, and foster collaboration between IT and OT teams. Rather than pursuing integration for its own sake, focus on solving specific operational challenges—reducing unplanned downtime, optimizing energy consumption, improving quality consistency, or accelerating time-to-market.

The manufacturers who master IT/OT convergence will operate with unprecedented efficiency, agility, and intelligence. They'll transform from reactive problem-solvers into proactive optimizers, creating sustainable competitive advantages in an increasingly digital manufacturing landscape.

## Bridge the IT/OT Gap with FlowFuse

FlowFuse is built on Node-RED, an open-source platform with over 5,000 pre-built nodes that connect to industrial protocols, databases, and business systems. This means you can integrate Modbus devices with your ERP system, or connect OPC-UA machines to cloud platforms without custom programming.

The visual, drag-and-drop interface lets your engineers and technicians build integration workflows directly. People who understand your processes can implement solutions themselves, reducing dependency on external developers and speeding up project delivery.

FlowFuse adds enterprise features like team collaboration, version control, and secure deployment to the Node-RED foundation, making it suitable for production manufacturing environments.
