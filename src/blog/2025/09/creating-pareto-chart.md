In the [first part of this series](/blog/2025/08/pareto-chart-manufacturing-guide/), we explored the foundational principles of the Pareto Chart, understanding how this powerful tool can help manufacturing teams quickly identify and focus on the "vital few" problems that have the biggest impact. We learned that by combining a bar graph and a cumulative percentage line, a Pareto Chart provides a clear visual roadmap to prioritize quality issues, equipment downtime, or other key performance indicators.

Now, it’s time to move from theory to practice. This guide will show you how to build your first Pareto Chart in FlowFuse, a low-code platform that simplifies industrial data workflows. You will learn how to connect to your production data, calculate frequencies and format data, and visualize the results in a chart that helps your team make data-driven decisions.

## Getting Started

To begin building your first Pareto Chart, make sure a FlowFuse Node-RED instance is running on your local machine or in the cloud. If you do not have an account yet, you can [sign up for a 14-day free trial](https://app.flowfuse.com/).

### Step 1: Connect to Your Data Source

The first step in creating a Pareto Chart is connecting to the data that you want to analyze. Production environments typically collect machine or process data through [protocols](/node-red/protocol/) such as **[OPC-UA](/blog/2025/07/reading-and-writing-plc-data-using-opc-ua/)**, **[MQTT](/blog/2024/06/how-to-use-mqtt-in-node-red/)**, or direct [database](/node-red/database/) queries.

In FlowFuse:

1. Drag the relevant input node into your flow (for example, an OPC-UA Read node).
2. Configure the connection details to point to your production system.
3. Test the connection to ensure live data is flowing.

If a live PLC or factory dataset is not available, you can start with a simple Inject node in FlowFuse to simulate production data.

### Step 2: Format and Aggregate the Data

Once the data is flowing, the next step is to **organize it into categories and count how often each category appears**. A Pareto Chart becomes useful when you can say, for example:

*“Machine Jam – 20 occurrences, Sensor Fault – 10 occurrences, Packaging Error – 5 occurrences.”*

In FlowFuse, you can achieve this in three steps:

1. **Format the data** – Use a JSON, CSV, or Change node if the incoming data needs to be cleaned or converted.

2. **Aggregate in a Function node** – Map each event to a label (such as a machine type, process step, or category) and keep a running count of how many times each one occurs.

   > **Tip:** You do not need to know JavaScript. Simply describe the outcome you want and provide a sample dataset—the **FlowFuse AI Assistant** will generate the Function node for you. [Learn more](/blog/2025/07/flowfuse-ai-assistant-better-node-red-manufacturing/).

3. **Sort the results** – Use a Sort node to arrange the categories so the most frequent ones appear first.

At the end of this step, your events should be transformed into a structure like this, which is the **required format for the Pareto Chart** in Step 3:

```json
[
  { type: "Scratch on Surface", value: 12 },
  { type: "Misaligned Parts", value: 7 },
  { type: "Paint Defect", value: 5 },
  { type: "Loose Screws", value: 3 },
  { type: "Faulty Electronics", value: 2 },
  { type: "Cracked Housing", value: 1 }
]
```

### Step 3: Visualizing the Chart

Before proceeding, ensure that you have installed the **`@flowfuse/node-red-dashboard`** node. This library provides the essential user interface components needed to create a real-time dashboard in Node-RED.

1. Open the **FlowFuse Editor** and click on the **hamburger menu** (☰) in the top-right corner.
2. Select **Manage palette**.
3. Navigate to the **Install** tab.
4. Search for **`@flowfuse/node-red-dashboard`** and click **Install**.

After installation, new UI nodes such as **UI Chart**, **UI Gauge**, and **UI Template** will appear in your palette. These nodes allow you to build interactive dashboards for industrial applications.

While the standard **UI Chart** node supports most common chart types, it does not provide a native **Pareto chart**. To achieve this, you can use the **UI Template** node, which enables you to embed custom code and create fully customized visualizations.

Below is a Pareto Chart implementation built using the **UI Template** node. You can copy the following flow and import it directly into your Node-RED editor to reuse it:

{% endrenderFlow %}

The Pareto Chart you just imported expects input data in a **specific JSON format**, like this:

```json
[
  { name: "Scratch on Surface", value: 5 },
  { name: "Misaligned Parts", value: 3 },
  { name: "Paint Defect", value: 8 },
  { name: "Loose Screws", value: 2 },
  { name: "Faulty Electronics", value: 6 },
  { name: "Cracked Housing", value: 1 }
]
```

To connect your **real production data**:

1. Make sure your upstream data flow (from OPC-UA, MQTT, or database nodes) is cleaned and aggregated into this format.
2. Wire the output of that flow into the **Pareto Chart (UI Template)** node you imported and deploy the flow.
3. Each time new data is received, the chart will automatically re-render with the updated bars (frequency) and cumulative percentage line.

To open the dashboard, click the Open Dashboard button located in the top-right corner of the Dashboard 2.0 sidebar. Once opened, you will see the Pareto Chart with bars, the cumulative line, and the 80% threshold.

The chart displays the types of defects using bar charts. Observe the cumulative line and the 80% threshold: the point where they intersect marks the cutoff. The bars to the left of this intersection represent the vital few defects that contribute most to the total.

## Takeaways

By following the steps outlined above, you have successfully built a **Pareto Chart in FlowFuse** that transforms raw production data into clear, actionable insights. This visualization allows manufacturing teams to quickly identify the **vital few** issues that have the greatest impact on operations, enabling more focused problem-solving and continuous improvement.

The combination of FlowFuse’s low-code interface and the flexibility of the FlowFuse Dashboard provides a powerful way to integrate, process, and visualize real-time industrial data without heavy coding. With this chart in place, you can now monitor trends, track recurring defects, and make data-driven decisions that improve efficiency and product quality.

Next steps: experiment with different datasets, integrate live production data, and explore additional dashboard components to build a complete industrial analytics solution. FlowFuse takes care of deployment, scalability, and security, while offering enterprise features such as team collaboration, snapshots, and DevOps tools—making it easy to build and deploy to thousands of instances without hassle.
