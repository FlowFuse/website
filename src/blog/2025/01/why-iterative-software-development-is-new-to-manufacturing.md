Iterative development is a core principle in software development, where methodologies like Agile, Scrum, and Kanban emphasize continuous, incremental progress. This approach allows software products to evolve through repeated cycles, with each cycle delivering small, manageable updates. Developers can gather user feedback, make adjustments, and improve the product over time, ensuring that it remains aligned with changing requirements and user needs.

In the manufacturing industry, however, this concept is still relatively new. For years, manufacturing has operated under a more linear, rigid framework. Once a product is designed and production begins, any changes can be costly and time-consuming. This traditional model, focused on mass production and efficiency, didn’t leave much room for quick adaptations. However, as technology advances, there is a growing shift toward more flexible, iterative approaches in manufacturing. This blog will explore why iterative development is so integral to software, why it’s less common in manufacturing, and how emerging technologies are paving the way for this change in industrial environments.

### The Traditional Manufacturing Model

For decades, manufacturing has relied on a **waterfall approach**—a linear and sequential process where each phase of production is completed before the next begins. The idea is that you fully design and plan a product, finalize all specifications, and only then move on to building and testing. This means a lot of upfront investment in terms of resources, time, and money. If a problem arises late in the process—say, during full-scale production—fixing it can be costly and time-consuming.

This linear process made sense when the industry relied on mass production techniques where economies of scale and fixed designs ruled the day. Once a product is designed and production begins, manufacturers would ideally produce large quantities without many changes. The process was designed for efficiency and minimizing variability. However, this approach is inherently slow to adapt. It doesn't account for changes in market demand, evolving consumer preferences, or unforeseen technical issues. 

### Why Software Embraces Iterative Development

The software development industry, in contrast, operates in a digital environment that allows for much greater flexibility and rapid changes. Software code can be written, tested, and deployed quickly, and bugs can be fixed almost instantaneously. As a result, the software development process has evolved into a highly iterative one. In **Agile** development, for example, products are developed in small, manageable increments, called **sprints**, each lasting a few weeks. At the end of each sprint, a usable version of the product is delivered, and feedback is gathered. The development team then revises the product based on user feedback or new requirements. 

This ability to make rapid changes is a significant advantage in an industry where customer needs can change quickly, and technological advancements happen fast. In fact, the quicker a software product can evolve in response to these changes, the more successful it tends to be. Because of this flexibility, software development has fully embraced iterative, feedback-driven models that promote continuous improvement. At **FlowFuse**, we adopt this philosophy in our work, where continuous feedback and improvement are fundamental to delivering high-quality, adaptive products.

### Challenges That Make Iterative Development New to Manufacturing

While iterative development has become second nature in the software industry, manufacturing has traditionally been constrained by the physical nature of production. The process of changing or improving a product once it enters production can be costly and time-consuming, which is why manufacturers have historically favored more rigid, linear workflows.

One of the primary challenges is the **cost and time constraints** inherent in manufacturing. When a product is designed and production begins, the investments in machinery, tooling, labor, and materials are significant. If a change needs to be made to the product design midway through the production process, it often requires retooling equipment, adjusting assembly lines, or even redesigning molds. These changes come with a substantial cost, not only in terms of money but also in the time required to make the necessary adjustments. Manufacturers tend to avoid these disruptions to maintain efficiency, which makes quick iterations difficult.

Another challenge lies in the **complexity of physical systems** involved in manufacturing. Unlike software, where changes can be made relatively quickly within a codebase, modifications to manufacturing processes usually require physical changes to machinery, the supply chain, or even the product's materials. These adjustments aren’t instantaneous; they require careful planning and execution. For example, if a product design needs to be tweaked, this could lead to delays in production, necessitate new parts or materials, or require a complete overhaul of a production line. Even seemingly minor design changes can trigger ripple effects throughout the entire system, making it difficult to implement agile, iterative changes in a traditional manufacturing setting.

Additionally, **feedback delays** are a significant hurdle in manufacturing. In software, feedback is often instantaneous, gathered through tools like surveys, usage data, or online analytics. Developers can quickly pivot based on this feedback. In contrast, feedback in manufacturing often comes much later—sometimes only after a product has been tested or delivered to customers. This delayed feedback loop means manufacturers can't always respond quickly to issues or new requirements, making it difficult to implement an agile, iterative development cycle. By the time feedback is gathered, the product may already be in mass production, making changes more challenging and costly.

### The Shift Towards Iterative Development in Manufacturing

Despite these challenges, the tide is starting to change, and iterative development is becoming feasible in manufacturing. Thanks to several emerging technologies, manufacturers are finding new ways to embrace flexibility, speed, and continuous improvement.

One of the biggest game-changers is **additive manufacturing**, or **3D printing**. This technology allows manufacturers to produce prototypes, parts, and even final products without needing to create expensive molds or tools. Because 3D printing is far less resource-intensive than traditional manufacturing, it enables much faster iterations and testing of product designs. Designers can quickly make adjustments based on feedback and produce updated versions of a product much more quickly than with conventional methods.

Another promising development is the use of **digital twins** and **simulation technology**. A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical product, system, or process. This allows manufacturers to simulate and test different scenarios in a virtual environment before making any changes to the real product. By simulating a product's behavior or the manufacturing process, engineers can identify issues early, make adjustments, and iterate on designs without waiting for physical prototypes. This virtual feedback loop is shortening the time it takes to make changes and improving the overall product quality.

Additionally, the increasing use of **unified data architecture** is helping to prevent data silos and promote collaboration across different departments. This integrated approach allows for real-time data sharing and coordination, which is crucial for enabling iterative development across the manufacturing process.

Finally, **modular design** is helping manufacturers embrace iteration. By creating products with interchangeable components, manufacturers can focus on improving individual parts of a product without having to redesign the entire system. This modular approach allows for quicker adaptations and testing of new ideas, facilitating iterative changes and faster time-to-market.

#### The Toyota Example: Iterative Development in Action

A well-established example of iterative development in manufacturing is the **Toyota Production System (TPS)**, which incorporates continuous, incremental improvements through the philosophy of [Kaizen](https://mag.toyota.co.uk/kaizen-toyota-production-system/). Unlike the traditional, rigid manufacturing process, Toyota has embraced iterative improvements as a core part of its operations. This approach allows the company to continuously optimize its manufacturing processes while keeping costs down and ensuring high product quality.

**Kaizen**, which means "change for the better," involves making small but regular changes to production lines, workflows, and designs. Every worker, from assembly line operators to top managers, is encouraged to identify inefficiencies or quality issues and propose solutions. These improvements, although small on their own, accumulate over time and result in significant gains in efficiency, cost reduction, and product quality.

A concrete example of this iterative process is Toyota's use of the **Andon Cord** on its assembly lines. If a worker notices a defect or problem during the production process, they can pull the Andon Cord to halt production. This immediate feedback loop ensures that the issue is resolved quickly, rather than allowing it to snowball into a bigger problem. This rapid intervention and continuous improvement cycle mirrors iterative development practices seen in software development.

In addition to Kaizen, Toyota has also utilized **just-in-time production (JIT)** and **Jidoka** (automation with a human touch) to create a system that allows for rapid adjustments without compromising quality or efficiency. These practices allow Toyota to iteratively improve not just products, but also the processes and systems that create them. This ongoing, iterative feedback and adaptation make Toyota a leader in operational efficiency and product innovation.

### Conclusion

Iterative development, long the backbone of software, is gradually finding its place in manufacturing. Thanks to technologies like 3D printing, digital twins, and modular design, manufacturers are now able to adapt faster, reduce costs, and improve product quality through continuous iteration. Much like software, manufacturing can now embrace the flexibility of feedback-driven processes to accelerate innovation and adapt to changing demands. This shift is not just about improving efficiency—it’s about transforming how manufacturers innovate and compete in an increasingly fast-paced world. Iterative development is no longer a trend—it is the future of manufacturing.
