Iterative development is a core principle in software development, where methodologies like Agile, Scrum, and Kanban emphasize continuous, incremental progress. This approach allows software products to evolve through repeated cycles, each delivering minor, manageable updates. Developers can gather user feedback, make adjustments, and improve the product over time, ensuring it remains aligned with changing requirements and user needs.

For decades, manufacturing has relied on more linear and sequential process where each production phase is completed before the next begins. The idea is that you fully design and plan a product, finalize all specifications, and only then move on to building and testing. This means much upfront investment in resources, time, and money. If a problem arises late in the process—say, during full-scale production—fixing it can be costly and time-consuming.

This linear process made sense when the industry relied on mass production techniques, and economies of scale and fixed designs ruled the day. Once a product is designed and production begins, manufacturers would ideally produce large quantities without many changes. The process was designed for efficiency and minimizing variability. However, this approach is inherently slow to adapt. It doesn't account for changes in market demand, evolving consumer preferences, or unforeseen technical issues. 

## **What Exactly is Iterative Development?**

**Planning → Designing → Implementation → Testing → Gathering Feedback**

Iterative development is a dynamic approach to product creation that focuses on incremental progress through repeated cycles, or iterations. The cycle typically starts with planning, where goals and priorities are set for the iteration. In the design phase, the team conceptualizes the next set of features or changes to be implemented. These are then built into a working version of the product. Once built, the product is tested to gather feedback—whether it’s from users, stakeholders, or internal testing. Based on this feedback, the product is then refined, addressing issues, optimizing performance, and enhancing features.

Each iteration allows for quick adjustments, reducing the risks associated with traditional "big bang" development. The result is a product that is continuously improved based on real-world feedback, with each iteration aligning more closely with customer needs and market demands.

## **Why Software Embraces Iterative Development**

The software development industry, in contrast, operates in a digital environment that allows for much greater flexibility and rapid changes. Software code can be written, tested, and deployed quickly, and bugs can be fixed instantly. As a result, the software development process has evolved into a highly iterative one. For example, in **Agile** development, products are developed in small, manageable increments, called **sprints**, each lasting a few weeks. At the end of each sprint, a usable version of the product is delivered, and feedback is gathered. The development team then revises the product based on user feedback or new requirements. 

This ability to make rapid changes is a significant advantage in an industry where customer needs can change quickly, and technological advancements happen fast. The quicker a software product can evolve in response to these changes, the more successful it becomes. Because of this flexibility, software development has fully embraced iterative, feedback-driven models that promote continuous improvement. At **FlowFuse**, we adopt this philosophy, where constant feedback and improvement are fundamental to delivering high-quality, adaptive products.

## Challenges of Adopting Iterative Development in Manufacturing

Manufacturing, unlike software, is deeply tied to physical processes, which makes adopting iterative development more complex. Once a production line is set up, changes come at a significant cost. The process typically involves heavy upfront investments in machinery, tooling, labor, and materials. If a change is needed during or after production, it may require retooling the entire system, which can be expensive and time-consuming. These challenges are compounded by the physical nature of products, where altering designs or features often means modifying tangible components—machinery, supply chains, and materials—each of which requires careful planning and significant resources. Unlike software, where adjustments can be made in minutes by tweaking code, these physical changes are far from instantaneous and often take weeks or months to implement.

Additionally, in many manufacturing processes, batch production is the norm. Once a batch is produced, modifying the design or features without affecting the entire batch is difficult. If a new model or design needs to be introduced, it could require scrapping or reworking previously produced units, adding to the cost and complexity. This batch model, common in industries like automotive and electronics, creates rigid constraints on change and slows down the iteration process. Regulatory and compliance constraints also limit the ability to iterate quickly. Industries like healthcare, aerospace, and automotive are heavily regulated, and any change in design often requires re-certification or new safety tests. Rapid iteration is hindered by these regulatory requirements, which require time to ensure that new product versions meet all necessary standards. This can significantly delay the process of testing, certifying, and releasing new versions of a product.

The integration of IT and OT systems also presents a challenge. Many manufacturing facilities still operate with a divide between IT (digital design and planning) and OT (physical production on the factory floor) systems. To adopt iterative development, manufacturers need seamless communication between these systems, but legacy OT systems often don't integrate easily with newer IT tools. Bridging this gap requires a significant investment in technology and can take considerable time to implement, delaying the transition to an agile production model.

The slower feedback loop in manufacturing also hinders the rapid changes that iterative development promotes. In software, developers can receive near-instant feedback through analytics, surveys, or user testing. In contrast, manufacturers often have to wait until after a product has been produced and delivered to customers before gathering feedback. By then, significant time and resources have already been invested, making quick adjustments difficult. Furthermore, any changes made at this stage usually involve revising physical products, which is a much slower and more costly process than altering a digital prototype.

## The Shift Towards Iterative Development in Manufacturing

Despite these challenges, several emerging technologies and strategies are enabling manufacturers to adopt more agile, iterative development processes. These technologies are addressing each of the core challenges that have traditionally made iterative development difficult in manufacturing.

Traditional manufacturing systems require significant upfront capital investment in machinery and tools. However, 3D printing (additive manufacturing) is enabling manufacturers to produce prototypes and small-batch parts without requiring costly molds or custom tools. This lowers the barrier to rapid iteration, allowing designers to quickly test new ideas without incurring high upfront costs. Additionally, modular production systems are offering flexible production lines that can be reconfigured to produce different product versions without major investment in new machinery, enabling more frequent design changes.

The cost and time associated with physical modifications to production lines are significant barriers to iterative development. However, digital twins—virtual replicas of products, systems, or processes—allow manufacturers to simulate and test design changes in a virtual environment before implementing them physically. This approach not only saves time but also helps identify issues early, reducing the need for costly physical adjustments. Similarly, simulation technologies allow manufacturers to test different configurations, optimizing designs and production processes without the need for physical prototypes.

The rigid constraints of batch production are being addressed by Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS), which allow manufacturers to produce small quantities of different products on the same production line. This reduces downtime and makes it possible to iterate on designs without halting production. By using FMS, manufacturers can quickly switch between products and adjust production processes, enhancing agility and enabling faster response times to market demands.

In highly regulated industries, design changes often require re-certification and additional safety tests, which can delay iteration. However, simulation testing and digital twins are playing a crucial role in overcoming these challenges. By creating virtual models of products, manufacturers can simulate and test design changes in a virtual environment, helping to identify potential compliance issues early in the development process. Additionally, compliance automation tools are streamlining the process of ensuring products meet regulatory standards, reducing the time needed for certification and approval.

The adoption of technologies like MQTT and Unified Namespace (UNS) is transforming how devices and systems communicate on the factory floor. MQTT enables real-time, lightweight data sharing between devices and systems, enhancing real-time monitoring and control. This facilitates quicker adjustments and improves the tracking of product performance and production efficiency. Unified Namespace (UNS) bridges the gap between IT  and OT by providing a centralized data architecture that ensures seamless communication across the entire production ecosystem. With UNS, manufacturers can integrate data from various machines, sensors, and systems into a single, unified framework, improving decision-making and response times. This integration reduces traditional delays in feedback, enabling manufacturers to make faster, more informed decisions, ultimately enhancing the iterative development process.

### The Toyota Example: Iterative Development in Action

A well-established example of iterative development in manufacturing is the **Toyota Production System (TPS)**, which incorporates continuous, incremental improvements through the philosophy of [Kaizen](https://mag.toyota.co.uk/kaizen-toyota-production-system/). Unlike the traditional, rigid manufacturing process, Toyota has embraced iterative improvements as a core part of its operations. This approach allows the company to continuously optimize its manufacturing processes while keeping costs down and ensuring high product quality.

**Kaizen**, which means "change for the better," involves making small but regular changes to production lines, workflows, and designs. Every worker, from assembly line operators to top managers, is encouraged to identify inefficiencies or quality issues and propose solutions. These improvements, although small on their own, accumulate over time and result in significant gains in efficiency, cost reduction, and product quality.

A concrete example of this iterative process is Toyota's use of the **Andon Cord** on its assembly lines. If workers notice a defect or problem during production, they can pull the Andon Cord to halt production. This immediate feedback loop ensures the issue is resolved quickly rather than allowing it to snowball into a bigger problem. This rapid intervention and continuous improvement cycle mirrors iterative development practices seen in software development.

In addition to Kaizen, Toyota has also utilized **just-in-time production (JIT)** and **Jidoka** (automation with a human touch) to create a system that allows for rapid adjustments without compromising quality or efficiency. These practices allow Toyota to iteratively improve products and the processes and systems that produce them. This ongoing, iterative feedback and adaptation make Toyota a leader in operational efficiency and product innovation.

## How Manufacturers Can Adapt Iterative Development

Adopting iterative development in manufacturing doesn’t have to mean completely changing everything at once. Start small with pilot projects—test agile methods on one product line or part of your process. This lets you experiment without disrupting the whole operation, and it helps you see where things are working or need improvement. Once you’ve learned from these smaller tests, you can slowly expand agile practices to other parts of the business.

One key to making iterative development work is using the right technologies. For example, 3D printing allows manufacturers to quickly create and test prototypes. This means you can try out new designs without spending too much on tools or molds. **Digital twins**, which are virtual copies of real-world systems, let you test product changes digitally before making them in the real world. This saves both time and money by catching problems early. These technologies make it easier to make quick changes and learn as you go, without big costs.

However, the real value of iterative development is in creating a mindset of continuous improvement. Manufacturers need to focus on getting feedback constantly—whether from teams within the company, customers, or suppliers. Having a system that lets you gather feedback quickly helps you respond to changes in the market or customer needs. The faster you can adapt, the more likely you are to stay ahead of competitors. Real-time feedback helps manufacturers spot issues early, improve products faster, and reduce risk.

The same agile thinking can be applied throughout the entire supply chain. For instance, an agile supply chain allows manufacturers to adjust quickly when there are changes in demand or supply chain issues. Modular designs also make it easier to improve individual parts of a product without having to change the whole product. This helps manufacturers keep things moving smoothly and respond quickly to changes.

Lastly, adopting iterative development is not just about tools or processes—it’s about changing the culture within the company. **Training your teams** on agile methods and encouraging collaboration at every level will create a culture of continuous improvement. When everyone in the company—from the design team to the production floor—feels responsible for making things better, the company can respond more quickly to challenges. This proactive mindset helps you fix problems before they become bigger issues and creates a more adaptable, innovative company.

In short, manufacturers don’t need to do everything at once. Start small, invest in the right technologies, and create a culture of feedback and improvement. Over time, this will lead to **greater efficiency, better innovation, and more flexibility**, giving you a competitive edge in an ever-changing market.

## Conclusion

Iterative development, common in software, is now transforming manufacturing by enabling faster, more flexible production. Technologies like 3D printing, digital twins, and modular systems are helping manufacturers adapt quickly, improve products continuously, and respond to market changes. Though it requires overcoming challenges, adopting agile methods can lead to more efficient, innovative manufacturing processes and a competitive edge in the evolving market.
