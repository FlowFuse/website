Iterative development is a core principle in software development, where methodologies like Agile, Scrum, and Kanban emphasize continuous, incremental progress. This approach allows software products to evolve through repeated cycles, each delivering minor, manageable updates. Developers can gather user feedback, make adjustments, and improve the product over time, ensuring it remains aligned with changing requirements and user needs.

For decades, manufacturing has relied on more linear and sequential process where each production phase is completed before the next begins. The idea is that you fully design and plan a product, finalize all specifications, and only then move on to building and testing. This means much upfront investment in resources, time, and money. If a problem arises late in the process—say, during full-scale production—fixing it can be costly and time-consuming.

This linear process made sense when the industry relied on mass production techniques, and economies of scale and fixed designs ruled the day. Once a product is designed and production begins, manufacturers would ideally produce large quantities without many changes. The process was designed for efficiency and minimizing variability. However, this approach is inherently slow to adapt. It doesn't account for changes in market demand, evolving consumer preferences, or unforeseen technical issues. 

## What Exactly is Iterative Development?

**Planning → Designing → Implementation → Testing → Gathering Feedback**

Iterative development is a dynamic approach to product creation that focuses on incremental progress through repeated cycles, or iterations. The cycle typically starts with planning, where goals and priorities are set for the iteration. In the design phase, the team conceptualizes the next set of features or changes to be implemented. These are then built into a working version of the product. Once built, the product is tested to gather feedback—whether it’s from users, stakeholders, or internal testing. Based on this feedback, the product is then refined, addressing issues, optimizing performance, and enhancing features.

Each iteration allows for quick adjustments, reducing the risks associated with traditional "big bang" development. The result is a product that is continuously improved based on real-world feedback, with each iteration aligning more closely with customer needs and market demands.

### Why Software Embraces Iterative Development

The software development industry, in contrast, operates in a digital environment that allows for much greater flexibility and rapid changes. Software code can be written, tested, and deployed quickly, and bugs can be fixed instantly. As a result, the software development process has evolved into a highly iterative one. For example, in **Agile** development, products are developed in small, manageable increments, called **sprints**, each lasting a few weeks. At the end of each sprint, a usable version of the product is delivered, and feedback is gathered. The development team then revises the product based on user feedback or new requirements. 

This ability to make rapid changes is a significant advantage in an industry where customer needs can change quickly, and technological advancements happen fast. The quicker a software product can evolve in response to these changes, the more successful it becomes. Because of this flexibility, software development has fully embraced iterative, feedback-driven models that promote continuous improvement. At **FlowFuse**, we adopt this philosophy, where constant feedback and improvement are fundamental to delivering high-quality, adaptive products.

### Challenges That Make Iterative Development New to Manufacturing

While iterative development has become second nature in the software industry, manufacturing has traditionally been constrained by its physical nature. Changing or improving a product once it enters production can be costly and time-consuming, which is why manufacturers have historically favored more rigid, linear workflows.

One of the primary challenges is the **cost and time constraints** inherent in manufacturing. When a product is designed and production begins, the investments in machinery, tooling, labor, and materials are significant. If a change needs to be made to the product design midway through the production process, it often requires retooling equipment, adjusting assembly lines, or even redesigning molds. These changes come with a substantial cost in terms of money and the time needed to make the necessary adjustments. Manufacturers tend to avoid these disruptions to maintain efficiency, which makes quick iterations difficult.

Another challenge lies in the **complexity of physical systems** involved in manufacturing. Unlike software, where changes can be made relatively quickly within a codebase, modifications to manufacturing processes usually require physical changes to machinery, the supply chain, or even the product's materials. These adjustments aren’t instantaneous; they require careful planning and execution. For example, if a product design needs to be tweaked, this could lead to delays in production, necessitate new parts or materials, or require a complete overhaul of a production line. Even seemingly minor design changes can trigger ripple effects throughout the system, making implementing agile, iterative changes in a traditional manufacturing setting challenging.

Additionally, **feedback delays** are a significant hurdle in manufacturing. In software, feedback is often instantaneous, gathered through tools like surveys, usage data, or online analytics. Developers can quickly pivot based on this feedback. In contrast, input in manufacturing often comes much later—sometimes only after a product has been tested or delivered to customers. This delayed feedback loop means manufacturers can't always respond quickly to issues or new requirements, making implementing an agile, iterative development cycle difficult. When feedback is gathered, the product may already be in mass production, making changes more challenging and costly.

### The Shift Towards Iterative Development in Manufacturing

Despite these challenges, the tide is changing, and iterative development is becoming feasible in manufacturing. Thanks to several emerging technologies, manufacturers are finding new ways to embrace flexibility, speed, and continuous improvement.

One of the biggest game-changers is additive manufacturing or 3D printing. This technology allows manufacturers to produce prototypes, parts, and final products without creating expensive molds or tools. Because 3D printing is far less resource-intensive than traditional manufacturing, it enables much faster iterations and testing of product designs. Designers can quickly adjust based on feedback and produce updated versions of a product much more rapidly than conventional methods.

Another promising development is using digital twins and simulation technology. A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical product, system, or process. This allows manufacturers to simulate and test different scenarios in a virtual environment before changing the product. By simulating a product's behavior or the manufacturing process, engineers can identify issues early, make adjustments, and iterate on designs without waiting for physical prototypes. This virtual feedback loop shortens the time it takes to make changes and improves the overall product quality.

Additionally, the increasing use of **unified data architecture** is helping to prevent data silos and promote collaboration across different departments. This integrated approach allows for real-time data sharing and coordination, which enables iterative development across the manufacturing process.

Finally, modular design is helping manufacturers embrace iteration. By creating products with interchangeable components, manufacturers can focus on improving individual parts of a product without having to redesign the entire system. This modular approach allows for quicker adaptations and testing of new ideas, facilitating iterative changes and faster time to market.

#### The Toyota Example: Iterative Development in Action

A well-established example of iterative development in manufacturing is the **Toyota Production System (TPS)**, which incorporates continuous, incremental improvements through the philosophy of [Kaizen](https://mag.toyota.co.uk/kaizen-toyota-production-system/). Unlike the traditional, rigid manufacturing process, Toyota has embraced iterative improvements as a core part of its operations. This approach allows the company to continuously optimize its manufacturing processes while keeping costs down and ensuring high product quality.

**Kaizen**, which means "change for the better," involves making small but regular changes to production lines, workflows, and designs. Every worker, from assembly line operators to top managers, is encouraged to identify inefficiencies or quality issues and propose solutions. These improvements, although small on their own, accumulate over time and result in significant gains in efficiency, cost reduction, and product quality.

A concrete example of this iterative process is Toyota's use of the **Andon Cord** on its assembly lines. If workers notice a defect or problem during production, they can pull the Andon Cord to halt production. This immediate feedback loop ensures the issue is resolved quickly rather than allowing it to snowball into a bigger problem. This rapid intervention and continuous improvement cycle mirrors iterative development practices seen in software development.

In addition to Kaizen, Toyota has also utilized **just-in-time production (JIT)** and **Jidoka** (automation with a human touch) to create a system that allows for rapid adjustments without compromising quality or efficiency. These practices allow Toyota to iteratively improve products and the processes and systems that produce them. This ongoing, iterative feedback and adaptation make Toyota a leader in operational efficiency and product innovation.

### How Manufacturers Can Adapt Iterative Development

Adopting iterative development in manufacturing can seem challenging, but the benefits far outweigh the initial investment. To get started, manufacturers don’t need to completely overhaul their processes—small, incremental steps can lay the foundation for broader transformation. Begin with pilot projects: test agile methods on a specific product line or phase of production. Focusing on a controlled environment allows you to fine-tune your approach without significant risks or disruptions.

Investing in **technologies like 3D printing, digital twins, and modular design** can significantly reduce the cost of trial and error. With 3D printing, for instance, you can rapidly prototype parts, experiment with designs, and quickly incorporate feedback—all without the need for expensive tooling or retooling. Digital twins enable you to simulate changes in a virtual environment, drastically cutting down on the time and resources required to test and refine products. These technologies speed up iteration cycles and help you catch potential issues early—before they become costly problems.

The real value comes when manufacturers shift to a mindset of continuous improvement. This is where the magic happens: **iterative development is not just about tweaking designs**—it’s about continuously refining your entire operation. Encourage **real-time feedback** loops internally from your teams and externally from customers. Create a system where every phase—design, production, or post-launch—is an opportunity to learn and improve. This feedback culture fosters agility, helping you adapt to market changes, customer preferences, and even supply chain disruptions faster and with less risk.

As you build confidence with small iterations, consider applying these practices across other parts of your operation. **Agile supply chains** and **modular design** allow you to be nimble and respond to shifting demands or design changes without a complete production overhaul. With modular products, for example, you can upgrade components independently without affecting the whole system, ensuring continuous product innovation and reducing costly delays.

Finally, embracing iterative development is not just about implementing new processes—it's about shifting your entire culture. Training your teams in agile methodologies, fostering collaboration, and encouraging innovation at every level will turn iteration from a process into a mindset. This approach empowers your workforce to be more adaptive, proactive, and forward-thinking—key qualities for long-term success in today’s manufacturing landscape.

By starting small, investing in the right technologies, fostering a culture of feedback, and gradually scaling agile practices, manufacturers can unlock greater **efficiency, innovation, and adaptability**. These competitive advantages will drive success in an increasingly dynamic and unpredictable market.
