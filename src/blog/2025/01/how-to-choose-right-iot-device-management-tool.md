In this guide, we’ll walk you through the key features and considerations you should evaluate when selecting IIoT device management software. Whether you’re a small manufacturer just beginning to implement IIoT or a larger enterprise with a more complex system, these insights will help you choose a platform that aligns with your needs.

### 1. Remote Access

The ideal IoT device management software should have robust remote access capabilities to enable easy and efficient management of devices across different locations. Remote access is essential for businesses operating in multiple regions or running devices 24/7. This feature allows your team to monitor device performance, troubleshoot problems, and deploy updates without being physically on-site. Remote access minimizes downtime and increases flexibility, ensuring your devices are always operational, regardless of location.

In addition, security is a significant consideration when managing devices remotely. The platform should offer secure remote connections such as VPNs, end-to-end encryption, and reverse SSH tunneling. These features ensure unauthorized individuals cannot access your devices or sensitive data, safeguarding your network from potential cyber threats.

### 2. Automated Monitoring and Alerts

In manufacturing, constant device health monitoring is crucial to prevent failures leading to expensive downtime. IIoT management platforms should automatically track key performance metrics such as device crashes, CPU usage, etc. By continuously monitoring these parameters, the platform can detect anomalies early and notify your team of potential issues before they escalate into costly failures.

For example, suppose a device on the factory floor suddenly crashes due to a malfunction. In that case, an automated alert will notify your team, enabling them to respond quickly and take corrective action. This proactive approach ensures that issues are addressed before they disrupt production, helping to avoid unplanned downtime and maintain your operations' efficiency.

The platform should allow you to set customizable thresholds for specific performance metrics in addition to standard alerts. This means that your team will only receive alerts for issues that are truly critical, reducing the noise from less important events and allowing for more focused, efficient responses.

Automated monitoring and alerts save time and improve the overall reliability and productivity of your IIoT ecosystem by minimizing the risk of unanticipated device failures.

### 3. Device Grouping and Scalability

As your IIoT network grows, managing devices individually can become overwhelming. Instead, choose a platform that allows you to group devices by function, location, or type. For instance, you might group all the devices in production line 1 and deploy workflows or software updates and configurations with a single click.

Grouping devices makes it easier to update settings, deploy updates, or troubleshoot multiple devices at once. Scalability is also key: As your manufacturing operations expand, the platform should easily accommodate new devices without adding unnecessary complexity.

### 4. Wide Range of Device Support

In manufacturing, you're likely working with a diverse set of devices, each with different operating systems and functionalities. Choosing an IIoT device management platform that is device-agnostic is essential—meaning it can seamlessly manage a wide range of devices and operating systems without requiring separate management systems for each type.

For example, you might have one device running on Linux, another on Windows, and another using a custom OS. An ideal device management platform allows you to oversee all these devices from a single interface, streamlining operations and eliminating the need for multiple, fragmented platforms. This unified approach simplifies device management, reduces complexity, and enhances efficiency across your IIoT network.

### 5. Built-in DevOps Toolset

Automation is essential for boosting manufacturing efficiency. IIoT device management platforms with built-in DevOps tools integrate easily with production systems. They automate tasks like device setup, configuration, and software updates, helping reduce downtime and speed up troubleshooting.

DevOps pipelines allow you to create workflows tailored to your needs, automating updates and maintenance for IIoT devices. This means your platform can push updates without interrupting production, reducing the need for manual work.

With the flexibility to create custom DevOps pipelines, you can manage devices more efficiently, save time, minimize errors, and keep everything aligned with production requirements.

### 6. Accidental Recovery or Rollback

Another essential feature to look for is the ability to recover from system failures or accidental misconfigurations. Accidents can happen at any time, and being able to revert to a previous stable state quickly can save you from costly downtime and operational disruptions.

The ideal IIoT device management platform should include a snapshot or rollback functionality. This allows you to take snapshots of your device configurations and system state at various points in time. In the event of an issue, you can simply roll back to a previous snapshot, restoring your devices to their last known good state.

This feature is especially critical in production environments where system stability is key to preventing operations interruptions. It minimizes downtime, ensures data integrity, and provides peace of mind, knowing that you can recover quickly from mistakes or technical failures.

### 7. System And Audit Log Management

System and audit log management is crucial for troubleshooting, security, and compliance. The platform should keep detailed logs of device activities, errors, and user actions, making identifying and addressing issues quickly easier.

Audit logs show who accessed the system, what actions were taken, and when they occurred. This transparency helps identify security risks or unauthorized activities, allowing you to take action before problems escalate.
These logs are essential for compliance, in addition to troubleshooting and security. They provide a clear, accessible record of all changes, helping you ensure your system meets industry standards and regulations. This makes it easier to demonstrate compliance and maintain a secure operational environment.

### 8. Strong Security Features

Security is critical in IIoT, especially when handling sensitive production data. An ideal IIoT platform should provide end-to-end encryption to protect data as it moves between devices and the cloud.

This includes securing data from sensors that monitor product quality or track inventory levels in a manufacturing environment. The platform should also restrict device access based on user roles, ensuring only authorized personnel can modify settings or view sensitive data.

Vulnerability scanning and automatic security patching are essential to protect against threats before they impact your operations. The platform should also support the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), which helps track all software components and manage security risks from third-party software.

To further strengthen security, the platform should support multi-factor authentication (MFA), which adds an extra layer of protection. MFA ensures that only authorized users can access critical systems, even if login credentials are compromised.

### 9. User-Friendly Interface

Your team shouldn’t waste time struggling with a complicated platform in a busy manufacturing environment. Choose a device management platform with a simple, intuitive interface that makes monitoring devices, adjusting settings, and resolving issues quick and easy.

A clean, easy-to-navigate UI allows your team to stay focused on key tasks like tracking device health and performance without unnecessary complexity. Simple controls for configuring devices, applying updates, and onboarding new devices will save time and reduce frustration.

### 10. Cost Considerations

When choosing an IIoT device management platform, it’s essential to consider upfront and ongoing costs. Look beyond the initial price and think about the total cost of ownership, which includes licensing fees, training, and technical support.

For example, a platform that charges based on the number of devices may be cost-effective when starting with a smaller network, but it could become expensive due to the scale of your operation. Compare different pricing models to find the one that aligns with your budget and long-term growth plans.

### 11. Vendor Reputation and Support

IIoT systems are critical to your manufacturing operations, so choosing a vendor with a good reputation is essential. Look for companies with a proven track record in industrial environments and solid customer reviews. Check for customer support availability, especially in emergencies when downtime can be costly.

For example, a vendor that provides 24/7 support and clear documentation can be invaluable when troubleshooting issues during a production run. Strong post-sale support also ensures that your IIoT network operates smoothly.

### 12. Integration with Existing Systems

Ensure your device management platform integrates smoothly with your existing systems, like ERP and CRM. This helps streamline operations, whether tracking inventory or feeding data into your maintenance system.
