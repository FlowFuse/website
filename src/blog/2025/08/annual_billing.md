## How Annual Billing Works

Switching to annual billing is straightforward:

**New customers:** Select annual billing when signing up for Starter or Pro plans

**Existing customers:** To switch to annual billing, go to **Billing** → **Upgrade Team**. Enable the yearly billing toggle, then click Switch to Yearly Billing.



When you switch to annual billing, any unused time from your current bill will be applied as a credit on your new invoice. For example, if you paid for a month and you upgrade to annual billing halfway through the month, that remaining half of a month charge will be deducted from your next invoice.

As your applications grow with additional Node-RED instances, you may wonder what happens if you add or delete instances. Not a problem: additional instances beyond the basic allowance for your plan - one hosted instance for Starter, five instances for Pro - will be billed yearly as well, but if you remove instances the amount you have already paid will be prorated either toward the next yearly billing cycle or toward any new product subscriptions you add, whichever comes first.


Your annual subscription will automatically renew each year unless you choose to cancel, giving you continuous access to FlowFuse's comprehensive Node-RED hosting and development platform.

## Why Choose Annual Billing?

Beyond the immediate cost savings, annual billing offers several advantages for teams and individual developers:

**Financial Benefits:** Lock in current pricing for a full year and save money that can be invested back into your projects and development initiatives.

**Administrative Simplicity:** Reduce the overhead of monthly billing cycles and invoice processing, especially valuable for teams managing multiple subscriptions.

**Long-term Planning:** Annual commitments align well with project planning cycles and budget allocation, making it easier to plan your Node-RED development roadmap.

## Perfect for Growing Teams

Whether you're a solo developer working on IoT projects or part of a larger team building enterprise automation solutions, annual billing provides the stability and savings that support sustained growth and development.

Our Starter plan remains perfect for individual developers and small projects, while the Pro plan continues to offer the advanced features and scalability that growing teams need.
