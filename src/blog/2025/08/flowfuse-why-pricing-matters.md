The automation landscape is evolving rapidly, and recent industry developments have sparked important conversations about how businesses should evaluate their automation platforms. N8N’s recent shift from workflow-based to execution-based pricing — positioned as removing limits — has received mixed reactions from the community, with many growing businesses finding the reality more complex. As pricing models change across the industry, now is the perfect time to reflect on what truly matters when choosing the right automation solution for your needs.

## The Current State of Automation Pricing

Many automation platforms are rethinking their pricing structures, moving from workflow-based models to execution-based billing. While this approach aims to provide more flexibility, it can create new challenges for businesses trying to predict costs and plan their automation strategies.

Execution-based pricing means each step or run of your workflow consumes credits or counts toward your usage limits. What initially appears straightforward can become complex when scaling automation across teams and departments.

## What Business Users Really Need

Based on conversations we're seeing in automation communities, business users are looking for:

- **Cost predictability**: The ability to forecast automation expenses as operations grow
- **Scalability confidence**: Knowing their platform can handle increased complexity without surprises
- **Team collaboration**: Tools that support multiple users working together effectively
- **Enterprise readiness**: Solutions built to handle business-critical operations from the start

## FlowFuse: Built for Business Automation

FlowFuse takes a different approach to business automation, focusing on what enterprises actually need rather than trying to retrofit consumer tools for business use.

### Industrial-Grade Foundation

FlowFuse is designed as an Industrial Application Platform that empowers teams to build, deploy and manage applications that optimize industrial operations. This isn't an add-on feature—it's fundamental to how we approach automation.

### The Power of Node-RED

At the heart of FlowFuse is Node-RED, the free and truly Open Source low-code programming tool of choice for industrial applications. With over 5,000 community-contributed nodes, Node-RED enables engineers to collect, transform, and integrate data through visualized dashboards. It's been proven in everything from home automation to massive industrial deployments.

### Transparent Business Model

Rather than complex execution counting, FlowFuse focuses on delivering reliable automation that scales with your business needs. Our approach eliminates the guesswork and lets you focus on building solutions rather than calculating usage; costs scale with how many Node-RED runtimes you need to manage.

**Cost Transparency**: Can you clearly understand and predict your automation costs as you scale?

**Business Focus**: Is your platform designed for enterprise requirements, or adapted from simpler use cases?
