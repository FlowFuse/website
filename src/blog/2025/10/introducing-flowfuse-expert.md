We've had an exciting week launching MCP and ONNX nodes, and now we’ve added something else we're really excited about: our new **FlowFuse Expert**. It helps you build flows by providing step-by-step recipe in plain language.

<!--more-->

Instead of hunting through documentation or piecing together forum posts, you simply describe what you want to build and get a clear recipe for creating it.

Head over to [flowfuse.com](https://flowfuse.com) and you'll see it right on the home page. Type what you're trying to build. FlowFuse Expert might ask a few questions to clarify your setup, and once you answer, it will provide a simple, easy-to-follow recipe: which nodes you need with exact copyable names, how to configure them, and how to wire them together.

Down the road, we plan to integrate it directly into the Node-RED editor for FlowFuse users. So if you're already using [FlowFuse Assistant](/blog/2025/07/flowfuse-ai-assistant-better-node-red-manufacturing/) to speed up your development, FlowFuse Expert will be right there alongside it, answering questions and providing recipes for whatever you're trying to build.

## Why We Built This

We kept seeing people get stuck at the same point. They were excited about FlowFuse and Node-RED, with a clear idea of what they wanted to build, but weren't sure how to get started.

That gap between vision and implementation shouldn't be a bottleneck, nor should time be wasted reading long documents or articles. FlowFuse Expert provides the starting point, the specific guidance you need to start building, without dumbing anything down.

## How It Works

FlowFuse Expert is built on and runs entirely using FlowFuse technology itself. It is powered by RAG + GPT-4.1. We've ingested all of our blogs, changelogs, and documentation into a vector database. When you describe what you want to build, FlowFuse Expert searches this knowledge base and uses that context to generate accurate, and super simple step-by-step instructions.

## Try FlowFuse

FlowFuse Expert is just one of the many powerful tools we’ve made available to everyone. With FlowFuse, you can deploy, scale, and manage Node-RED effortlessly, accelerate development with FlowFuse AI-assistance, and build your own MCP server. Let AI agents monitor and control industrial applications using MCP nodes—or run your custom AI models in Node-RED with ONNX nodes.
