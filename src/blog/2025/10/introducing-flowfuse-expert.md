We've had an exciting week launching MCP and ONNX nodes, and now we’ve added something else we're really excited about: **FlowFuse Expert**. It helps you build flows by providing a step-by-step recipe to build an application in FlowFuse and Node-RED, in plain language. 

Oh, and it was created by and is running on FlowFuse technology! Take a look:

Instead of hunting through documentation or piecing together forum posts, you simply describe what you want to build and get a clear recipe for creating it.

Head over to [flowfuse.com](https://flowfuse.com) and you'll see it right on the home page. Type what you're trying to build. FlowFuse Expert might ask a few questions to clarify your setup, and once you answer, it will provide a simple, easy-to-follow recipe: which nodes you need with exact copyable names, how to configure them, and how to wire them together.

Down the road, we plan to integrate it directly into the FlowFuse environment. So if you're already using [FlowFuse Assistant](/blog/2025/07/flowfuse-ai-assistant-better-node-red-manufacturing/) to speed up your development, FlowFuse Expert will be right there alongside it, answering questions and providing recipes for whatever you're trying to build.

## Why We Built This

We kept seeing people get stuck at the same point. They were excited about FlowFuse and Node-RED, with a clear idea of what they wanted to build, but weren't sure how to get started.

That gap between vision and implementation shouldn't be a bottleneck, nor should time be wasted reading long documents or articles. FlowFuse Expert provides the starting point, the specific guidance you need to start building, without dumbing anything down.

## How It Works

FlowFuse Expert is built on and runs entirely using FlowFuse technology itself. It is powered by RAG + GPT-4.1. We've ingested all of our blogs, changelogs, and documentation into a vector database. When you describe what you want to build, FlowFuse Expert searches this knowledge base and uses that context to generate accurate, and super simple step-by-step instructions.

## Try FlowFuse

FlowFuse Expert is just one of the many powerful tools we’ve made available to everyone. With FlowFuse, you can deploy, scale, and manage Node-RED effortlessly, accelerate development with FlowFuse AI-assistance, and build your own MCP server. Let AI agents monitor and control industrial applications using MCP nodes—or run your custom AI models in Node-RED with ONNX nodes.
