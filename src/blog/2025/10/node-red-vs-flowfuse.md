FlowFuse is an industrial data platform built on Node-RED. Many Fortune 500 manufacturers and Industrial IoT companies use it to run mission-critical operations where downtime is not an option.

If you're hearing about FlowFuse for the first time, you might wonder: *"If it's built on Node-RED, what makes it different?"*

This article answers that question. You'll learn what FlowFuse adds to Node-RED, whether it competes with Node-RED, and how to decide which platform is right for you.

## Where Node-RED Came From

To understand what FlowFuse adds, it helps to first look at Node-RED itself.

In 2013, Nick O'Leary (CTO and Founder of FlowFuse) and Dave Conway-Jones at IBM identified a problem: connecting devices, APIs, and services required hundreds of lines of code for tasks that should be straightforward. Their solution was to make programming visual. Drag nodes, draw connections, deploy your logic.

Engineers who understood systems but couldn't code could suddenly build applications. Tasks that took weeks were completed in hours. Node-RED runs on laptops, Raspberry Pis, factory floor gateways, and enterprise servers. The community has built thousands of nodes for most scenarios you'll encounter.

For small projects, prototypes, and learning, Node-RED provides what you need without overhead.

## When Limitations Surface

Your Node-RED flow works. It monitors equipment, processes data, displays dashboards. Then someone asks: *"Can we deploy this across all 50 of our factories?"*

That question exposes the limitations of standalone Node-RED:

You need to deploy to 50 sites across three continents without manual setup at each location. Five engineers need to work on improvements without conflicts. You need alerts when any instance goes down because downtime stops production. Your security team requires SSO integration, role-based access control, and audit trails. You need to push updates to all sites at once, not travel to each location over weeks. When someone deploys a breaking change on Friday afternoon, you need to roll it back in seconds.

That question highlights the limitations of standalone Node-RED:

**Node-RED gives you the tools to build. FlowFuse provides the infrastructure to deploy, manage, and scale what you've built.**

## What FlowFuse Adds

FlowFuse doesn't replace Node-RED. You use the same visual editor, the same nodes, and build the same flows. FlowFuse adds the operational capabilities your team will eventually need.

### Security and Compliance

Standard Node-RED has no built-in user management. Authentication is whatever you implement yourself—usually basic auth or custom middleware. For personal use, this works. For platforms controlling industrial equipment, your security team will reject it.

FlowFuse includes role-based access control. Define who edits flows, and who gets read-only access. SSO via SAML, LDAP means Node-RED authenticates against your existing identity provider. Audit logs capture who deployed what and when. When compliance requests access records from Q2, you have them.

FlowFuse handles secrets management. Your flows need database credentials, API token. FlowFuse allows to stores them with environment vars which prevents them from ending up in flow exports.

For software supply chain security, FlowFuse generates a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). This inventory of every node and dependency across all of your team's instances allows security teams to scan for vulnerabilities and check for available updates.

### Team Collaboration and Version Control

Node-RED wasn't designed for teams. Two people editing the same instance means the last save wins and someone's work disappears. There's no version control, no change review before deployment, no branching or merging.

FlowFuse enables team collaboration. Your team works on the same project without conflicts. 

Every deployment creates a snapshot showing your flows at that point in time. Compare snapshots to see what changed between Tuesday and Thursday. If a deployment breaks production, roll back in seconds.

### Remote Device Management and Monitoring

Managing a single Node-RED instance is simple. Managing ten is tedious. Managing hundreds across factories, edge gateways, and cloud regions is an operational nightmare. How do you update them, monitor their health, or troubleshoot issues without being on-site?

FlowFuse solves this with its Device Agent and a centralized management platform. The Device Agent is a lightweight service installed on your remote devices that establishes a secure, persistent connection back to your FlowFuse instance. This gives you a single pane of glass to see and control your entire fleet of devices.

This architecture unlocks critical capabilities. You can remotely access a device's editor and logs through a secure tunnel, eliminating the need for risky open ports or complex VPNs. You can monitor the health and status of every device in real-time. Pushing updates, which you define in your DevOps pipeline, becomes a reliable over-the-air (OTA) process managed from the central platform. This transforms remote management from a reactive, time-consuming challenge into a proactive, scalable operation.

### DevOps Pipelines and Device Groups

With standalone Node-RED, moving from development to production is often a manual process of exporting and importing flows—an approach that doesn't scale and is prone to error. FlowFuse introduces a structured DevOps workflow directly into the platform.

FlowFuse allows you to create deployment pipelines. You can set up distinct environments—such as Development, Staging, and Production—for each project. Once a flow is tested and validated in a lower environment, you can promote its snapshot to the next stage with a single click. This ensures that only trusted, version-controlled code reaches your critical systems.

This is complemented by powerful device management. You can organize your remote instances (devices) into logical groups based on location, function, or any other criteria. Need to roll out an update to all the packaging lines in your North American factories? Simply push the new snapshot to that specific device group. This combination of pipelines and grouping transforms Node-RED deployment from a manual task into an automated, reliable, and scalable process.

### Built-in Observability

Standalone Node-RED shows logs. For centralized monitoring, you integrate Prometheus, configure exporters, build Grafana dashboards, and set up alerts. This takes weeks.

FlowFuse includes observability as a core platform feature. It automatically aggregates logs from all instances into a single, searchable interface. Comprehensive health monitoring tracks every instance, providing real-time insights into its status, as well as its CPU and memory usage, without any manual setup.

You get deployment visibility. Which instances run which versions? When were they updated? What's the rollout history? Questions are answered without investigating across distributed systems.

### Managed Infrastructure

Running Node-RED means managing infrastructure—servers or edge devices, installation procedures, update mechanisms, backup strategies, and disaster recovery plans. For a few instances, this is manageable. For dozens or hundreds, it becomes someone's job.

FlowFuse offers two options: FlowFuse Cloud is managed—they run everything, you build applications. FlowFuse Self-Hosted runs on your infrastructure but handles orchestration, updates, and management.

Both provide over-the-air updates. you can roll out Node-RED versions, security patches, and configuration changes quickly. Maintenance that required coordinated downtime happens without interruption.

### Certified Nodes and Blueprint Library

While the real power of Node-RED is its open-source, the real fear in the professional world is relying on that same open source. You're not always sure if nodes are well-maintained or free of vulnerabilities.

FlowFuse addresses this with the Certified Nodes program. We vet community nodes for quality, maintenance, and security. Authors can register for certification, and from there, we take responsibility. If you don't find a certified node you need, you can request it, and we will work to certify it. This provides a trusted palette of tools you can use with confidence.

Beyond trusted nodes, FlowFuse accelerates development with a Blueprint Library. Blueprints are pre-built, reusable flow templates that solve common industrial and IoT problems. Instead of starting from scratch, your team can deploy a proven solution for tasks like building an OEE dashboard, implementing an Andon system, creating a performance terminal for operators, or providing a simple CRUD operations example. This not only saves hundreds of development hours but also enforces best practices and standardization across your organization, ensuring that solutions are both robust and consistent.

## FlowFuse Ai Assisntant

To accelerate development and lower the barrier to entry, FlowFuse integrates an AI Assistant directly into the editor. This intelligent co-pilot supports you at every stage of the development lifecycle, acting as a partner to your engineering team. It can generate function nodes, create UI templates for the FlowFuse dashboard using natural language, explain complex flows, quickly generate documentation, provide auto-suggestions for the next node, and assist in writing SQL queries from natural language.

### Support with SLAs

Node-RED's community support works well for learning and troubleshooting. When production is down and costing money per minute, you need more than forum posts.

FlowFuse provides support with SLAs. You talk to engineers who know Node-RED internals and FlowFuse architecture. They've seen edge cases, understand failure modes, and can help architect solutions that scale.

## When to Choose What

**Use Node-RED when:**
- You're learning, experimenting, or prototyping
- It's a personal project or runs locally
- You're managing one or two instances
- Collaboration means occasionally sharing flow files
- You have expertise and time to build operational infrastructure
- Control over every detail matters more than convenience
- Security and compliance requirements are straightforward

**Use FlowFuse when:**
- Your team needs to collaborate without conflicts
- You're taking a prototype to production
- You're managing more instances than you can handle manually
- Version control and rollback are operational requirements
- Security, compliance, and audit trails are required
- You're deploying across multiple sites or regions
- Remote device management is necessary
- Your team should build applications, not maintain infrastructure
- Downtime has business consequences

## Are Node-RED and FlowFuse Competitors?

No. Node-RED and FlowFuse are not competitors—they’re complementary. FlowFuse is built directly on top of Node-RED, and the two projects share deep roots. In fact, FlowFuse employees, including Node-RED’s co-creator Nick O’Leary, are among the most active contributors to Node-RED itself. They review pull requests, write code, run Node-RED Con, and maintain long-term support for the community.

When Node-RED improves, FlowFuse improves too. This is the same dynamic seen in other open-source ecosystems: Linux thrives alongside Red Hat, Kubernetes powers enterprise platforms, and PostgreSQL continues to evolve while vendors provide enterprise features. The open-source project remains free and independent, while the commercial platform adds operational value on top.

FlowFuse also invests back into the ecosystem. A good example is the [FlowFuse Dashboard](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com) (often called Node-RED Dashboard 2.0), which replaced the deprecated original Node-RED Dashboard. By sponsoring and maintaining this project, FlowFuse ensures the community continues to have a modern, supported visualization tool.

And importantly, your flows remain portable. Anything you build in FlowFuse works in plain Node-RED. There is no vendor lock-in. FlowFuse exists to extend Node-RED, not replace it.

## Making the Decision

If you're starting with Node-RED, start with standalone. Learn it, build projects, understand what it can and can't do. You'll know when you've outgrown it. Your team wants to collaborate. You spend more time managing infrastructure than building solutions. You need to deploy across locations. Security asks questions you can't answer.

The question isn't "FlowFuse or Node-RED?" It's "Do I need the operational platform FlowFuse provides?" For individuals and small teams with simple deployments, Node-RED works. For teams building production systems at scale, FlowFuse removes operational friction.

Both tools make building applications faster. Node-RED provides the development environment. FlowFuse provides the operational platform for running it across your organization. That's the difference.
