EtherNet/IP is one of the most widely used industrial communication protocols for connecting PLCs, sensors, and controllers across manufacturing environments. If you're working with Allen-Bradley PLCs—whether it's ControlLogix, CompactLogix, or MicroLogix—you're using some of the most trusted automation hardware in the industry.

<!--more-->

In this guide, you'll learn how to integrate your Allen-Bradley PLCs with FlowFuse using EtherNet/IP. We'll explore both connected and unconnected messaging modes, helping you understand which approach works best for your setup. By the end, you'll have learned to get your PLCs talking to FlowFuse and start building powerful industrial automation workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating your Allen-Bradley PLC with FlowFuse, ensure you have the following:

**PLC Configuration:**
- Your Allen-Bradley PLC (ControlLogix, CompactLogix, or MicroLogix) should be properly configured and operational.
- Ensure that the appropriate ladder logic program is written according to your requirements and successfully downloaded to the PLC.
- Verify that the controller tags or data structures you want to access are properly defined.
- Note the PLC's IP address and slot number (typically slot 0 for the processor).

**Node-RED:**
- Install Node-RED on the device that will communicate with the Allen-Bradley PLC. You cannot install Node-RED directly on the PLC, as PLCs are controllers, not computers. You can use devices like the Raspberry Pi, Revolution Pi, or industrial PCs to connect and transfer data across systems.
- Use the [FlowFuse Device Agent](https://flowfuse.com/product/device-agent/) to install Node-RED on your edge device.

**Network Setup:**
- Verify that the device running Node-RED is on the same network as the PLC and can successfully ping the PLC's IP address.
- Ensure the PLC is properly connected to the network via Ethernet with a static IP address configured.
- Ensure that firewalls do not block EtherNet/IP communication (typically port 44818 for both TCP and UDP).

## Understanding EtherNet/IP Communication Modes

EtherNet/IP supports two primary communication modes: connected and unconnected messaging. Your choice depends on how frequently you need to communicate with the PLC, how many connection resources are available, and—importantly—what your PLC actually supports. Not all PLCs support both modes. For example, Allen-Bradley Micro800 series PLCs only support connected messaging, while ControlLogix and CompactLogix typically support both.

### Connected Messaging

Connected messaging establishes a persistent session between Node-RED and the PLC using the Forward Open protocol. Once connected, data flows continuously with minimal overhead, making it ideal for real-time monitoring and high-frequency updates.

The advantage is speed—after the initial handshake, communication is fast and efficient. The tradeoff is that each session consumes one of the PLC's limited connection slots, typically ranging from 8 to 32 depending on the model.

**Without Routing (Direct Connection):**
For PLCs that connect directly via Ethernet without backplane routing, like Allen-Bradley Micro800/850/870 series. Only the IP address is needed—no slot number or routing path required.

**With Routing:**
Used for chassis-based PLCs like ControlLogix and CompactLogix, where the processor sits in a backplane slot. In this case, the slot number must be specified, as it automatically creates a routing path through the backplane to reach the processor.

### Unconnected Messaging

Unconnected messaging sends individual requests without maintaining a persistent connection. Each transaction is standalone—request, response, done.

This approach doesn't consume connection slots, making it ideal when resources are limited or when multiple systems need occasional PLC access. The downside is higher overhead per message, resulting in slower performance compared to connected mode.

In practice, use connected mode for frequent polling and unconnected mode for occasional reads or writes—but always check your PLC's documentation to confirm which modes are supported.

## Installing the EtherNet/IP Node

To communicate with Allen-Bradley PLCs from FlowFuse, we'll use `node-red-contrib-cip-ethernet-ip`. This node supports both connected and unconnected messaging modes for Allen-Bradley PLCs.

1. Open your FlowFuse Instance Node-RED editor in a web browser.

2. Click the main menu (three horizontal lines) in the top-right corner.

3. Select "Manage Palette" from the menu.

4. Switch to the "Install" tab and search for `node-red-contrib-cip-ethernet-ip`.

5. Click "Install" next to the node name.

6. Wait for the installation to complete.

Once installed, you'll find the EtherNet/IP nodes in your palette under the "network" category. The main nodes are `ethernet-ip in` for reading data and `ethernet-ip out` for writing data to the PLC.

## Configuring the EtherNet/IP Node

Now that you have installed the EtherNet/IP node, it is time to configure the connection to your Allen-Bradley PLC.

1. Drag an EtherNet/IP node onto the canvas — use **`ethernet-ip in`** for reading or **`ethernet-ip out`** for writing.

2. Double-click the node to open its configuration panel.

3. Click the pencil icon next to the **"PLC"** dropdown to add a new PLC configuration.

4. Enter the basic connection details:

   * Give your connection a descriptive name, such as **"Line 1 PLC"**, for easy identification.
   * Enter your PLC’s **IP address**.
   * Specify the **slot number** where your processor is located — typically **0** for CompactLogix. For ControlLogix, check your hardware configuration.

5. Configure the communication parameters:

   * **Cycle time** controls how often the node communicates with the PLC (for example, 500 ms means it updates twice per second).

6. Select the communication mode:

   * **Standard (Unconnected)** — This is the default option supported by most PLCs.
   * **Connected (With Routing)** — Use this option if you want to enable connected messaging with routing.

This node does not currently support connected messaging (without routing). I have developed an enhanced version — @sumit_shinde_84/node-red-contrib-cip-ethernet-ip-enhanced — which supports connected messaging (without routing) but is still under development.

If you need connected messaging without routing, you can use that node. To enable connected messaging without routing, select Connected (no routing) from the communication mode dropdown in the configuration dialog.

### Adding Tags to Read or Write

After configuring the endpoint, you need to specify which tags you want to read from or write to the PLC.

1. In the same configuration window, switch to the "Tags" tab.

2. Click the "+Add" button in the top-right corner to add a new tag.

3. Enter the tag details:
   - **Name**: Enter the exact tag name as it appears in your PLC program (e.g., "Motor1Speed" or "Program:MainProgram.Motor1Speed")
   - **Type**: Select the data type from the dropdown (e.g., BOOL, INT, DINT, REAL, etc.)

4. Repeat this process for each tag you want to monitor or control. You can add multiple tags that will all use the same PLC connection you configured earlier.

![Adding tags to read and write](./images/adding-tags.gif){data-zoomable}
_Adding tags to read and write_

If your tag belongs to a different scope, click the “+ Add” button at the top to create a new scope. Then, under that scope, add the tags in the same way.

5. Once you've added all your tags, click "Add" to save the configuration, then "Done" to close the editor.

6. Finally, deploy the flow by clicking the "Deploy" button in the top-right corner.

After deploying, check the connection status displayed below the node. A green dot with "online" means you're successfully communicating with your PLC. If you see an error, verify your IP address, slot number, and network connectivity.

**Important:** Tag names must match exactly as they appear in your PLC program—they are case-sensitive. Make sure to select the correct data type for each tag to ensure proper communication.

## Getting Started

Before we start, I'd like to show you what I've prepared—a flow where I'm sending commands to the PLC to control the stack light. To interact with it, I've built a nice dashboard using [FlowFuse Dashboard](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/). Here's a quick demonstration:

Now let’s learn how to build a flow that can both read and write data to your PLC.

### Writing Data to Your PLC

Writing to a PLC is where things get exciting—this is where you move from monitoring to actually controlling your equipment. Maybe you want to start a motor, adjust a setpoint, or trigger a sequence. Whatever your goal, the process is straightforward.

1. Drag an **`ethernet-ip out`** node onto the canvas.

2. Double-click the node to open its configuration.

3. Select the PLC configuration you created earlier from the dropdown.

4. Select the scope under which you added the tag, choose the tag that you want to write to.

5. From the **Tag** dropdown, select the tag you want to write to.

6. Click "Done".

7. Connect an **`inject`** node or any other input node to send data.

8. Deploy the flow and click inject button to test it.

The node expects the incoming message payload to contain the value you want to write to the tag. Make sure the type of value matches the data type you configured when adding the tag.

### Reading Single Tag from Your PLC

Reading data from your PLC is the foundation of any monitoring or control system. Whether you're tracking production counts, monitoring temperatures, or checking machine status, you'll start here.

Here's how to set it up:

1. Drag an **`ethernet-ip in`** node onto the canvas.

2. Double-click the node to open its configuration.

3. Select the PLC configuration you created earlier from the dropdown.

4. Select the scope under which you added the tag, choose the tag that you want to write to, and set the mode to "Single Tag".

5. From the **Tag** dropdown, select the tag you want to read.

![Configuring the EtherNet/IP in node to read a single tag from the PLC](./images/read-plc-tag.png){data-zoomable}

6. Click "Done".

7. Connect a **`debug`** node to view the data.

8. Deploy the flow.

The node will automatically read data based on your configured cycle time and output it.

*Note: Reading single tags individually isn't recommended for production use as it creates unnecessary network overhead. Consider using "All tags" mode or structuring your PLC with array data types to read multiple values efficiently in one request.*

### Reading Multiple Tags from Your PLC

Sometimes you need the full picture—not just one data point, but everything that matters for your process. Reading multiple tags at once gives you a complete snapshot of your system in a single message.

Let me show you how:

1. Drag an **`ethernet-ip in`** node onto the canvas.

2. Double-click the node to open its configuration.

3. Select the PLC configuration you created earlier from the dropdown.

4. In the **Mode** field, select **"All tags"** to read all configured tags together in a single message, or select **"All tags (one per msg)"** if you want each tag value sent as a separate message.

5. Click "Done".

6. Connect a **`debug`** node to view the data.

7. Deploy the flow.
