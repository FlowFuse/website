AI is moving fast, and with it, the tools we use to build intelligent applications.
Two interesting platforms that have emerged are OpenAI's AgentKit and FlowFuse.
While both offer AI capabilities, they are designed for very different purposes.
Let's break down the key differences to help you decide which platform is the
right fit for your needs.

## OpenAI's AgentKit: For building AI agents

[OpenAI's AgentKit](https://openai.com/index/introducing-agentkit/) is a toolkit for developers who want to build and deploy AI
agents. Key features of AgentKit include the Agent Builder, a low-code visual environment
for designing multi-agent workflows, and a Connector Registry
for managing data and tool connections.
It also provides ChatKit for embedding chat-based agent experiences,
Expanded Evals for measuring agent performance, and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT)
to customize reasoning models. Essentially, AgentKit is for developers who are
building AI-native applications and need a robust set of tools to create and
manage their agents within the OpenAI ecosystem.

## FlowFuse: The Bridge Between the Physical and Digital Worlds
FlowFuse, on the other hand, is built on the foundation of [Node-RED](/node-red/),
also a low-code platform. FlowFuse is specifically designed for industrial and
IoT applications, with a strong focus on what's known as "the edge" – the
physical world where data is generated by assets like sensors, machines, and other
devices.

This is where the user's point about edge data extraction comes in. FlowFuse
excels at managing and scaling fleets of Node-RED instances running on edge
devices. This allows engineers to easily and securely collect data from all their
industrial devices and sensors, effectively "fusing the physical with the digital."

## Key Differentiators

So, how do these two platforms really differ? The first key differentiator is
their core focus. AgentKit is for building AI agents that live in the digital
world of applications and services, whereas FlowFuse is for building and managing
end-to-end data applications that interact with the physical world through edge
devices.

AgentKit, in its current form, does not have a focus on edge data extraction.
Its purpose is to help you build the "brains" of an AI. FlowFuse's entire reason
for being is to provide the "nervous system" that connects those brains to the
real world. It's all about managing edge deployments and ensuring a reliable flow
of data from the edge.

The [FlowFuse AI Assistant](/blog/2025/07/flowfuse-ai-assistant-better-node-red-manufacturing/) is a powerful tool that helps engineers, even those
who aren't expert coders, to build and manage their Node-RED flows. For instance,
you can describe what you need in plain English and the assistant will generate
the necessary code. It can also analyze a complex flow and explain what it does,
making it easier to maintain. Furthermore, the assistant is a huge time-saver as
it can create realistic test data and even help you build custom dashboards to
visualize your data.

So, while AgentKit is a toolkit for building AI agents, the FlowFuse AI Assistant
is a tool that helps you build the applications that connect to the physical world.
It empowers any engineer to fuse the physical with the digital by making it easier
than ever to create the logic needed to collect, transform, and act on data from
the edge.

What's more, FlowFuse supports building [Model Context Protocol (MCP) agents](/blog/2025/07/flowfuse-release-2-20/#ai-assisted-node-red-with-smart-suggestions),
enabling AI to work directly at the edge. This means you can create AI
agents that not only process data from physical devices but also make decisions
right where the data is generated — with a lot less latency due to less Cloud
round-trips. This is especially important for industrial applications where
milliseconds matter.

## Conclusion

Choosing between OpenAI's AgentKit and FlowFuse comes down to what you're trying
to achieve. If your goal is to build sophisticated, AI-powered agents for your
applications and your focus is on the digital realm, then OpenAI's AgentKit is
the clear choice. However, if you need to connect to, manage, and extract data
from physical devices in the real world, and you want to empower your engineers
with an AI assistant that makes this process easier, then FlowFuse is the
platform for you.

In the end, these are two powerful but very different tools. AgentKit is for the
AI developer, while FlowFuse is for the industrial engineer who wants to bring
the power of AI to the edge. We're looking forward to how these technologies can
be combined in future!

## Ready to Connect Your Physical World?

While AgentKit is perfect for building AI agents in the digital realm, FlowFuse 
is built for the challenges of industrial and IoT data: managing edge 
deployments at scale, connecting to diverse industrial protocols, and ensuring 
reliable data flow from thousands of physical devices.

Whether you're monitoring production lines, building predictive maintenance 
systems, or implementing Industry 4.0 initiatives, FlowFuse provides the 
infrastructure to collect, transform, and act on data from the edge.
