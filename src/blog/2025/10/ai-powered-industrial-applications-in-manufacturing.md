IT and OT engineers in the manufacturing sector have the mandate to optimize production
systems, which is hard with the reality of a fragmented operational landscape. About
70% of manufacturers still rely on manual data collection, showing a deeper issue:
a base of unconnected or poorly integrated assets, often 
[in "brownfield" facilities where digital connectivity adoption is low](https://manufacturingleadershipcouncil.com/seventy-percent-of-manufacturers-still-enter-data-manually-2-37141/?stream=all-news-insights).
This creates data silos, making operational data invisible and inaccessible, which
directly influences productivity, hinders and slows understanding and thus in turn
optimization, and exposes firms to significant cybersecurity and operational risks.

The change FlowFuse is seeing is that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the
catalyst. AI is no longer just an analytical tool for post-processing clean data;
it is the technology that enables the data from any connected asset to be
interpreted at scale. By embedding a vast repository of human and machine
experience into accessible models, AI empowers existing Operational Technology
(OT) and Information Technology (IT) teams to connect any asset, regardless of
age, protocol, or context.

A three-phase journey for manufacturers to achieve data “heaven” and operational
excellence is outlined:
1. Connect & Collect
   Leveraging low-code platforms like the open-source Node-RED, supercharged by AI "co-pilots," to democratize the process of connecting to machines and collecting raw data.
1. Contextualize & Normalize
   Employing AI models to automatically standardize disparate data formats and enrich them with critical operational context, creating a single source of truth.
1. Visualize & Interact
   Utilizing advanced AI for intelligent interaction, from conversational analytics that allow natural language queries of factory data to computer vision for quality control and Large Language Models (LLMs) for sophisticated anomaly detection.

Platforms like FlowFuse, built on the widely adopted Node-RED ecosystem, provide
the enterprise-grade security, scalability, and collaborative DevOps tools necessary
to deploy these solutions in production environments. This serves as a strategic
blueprint for manufacturing leaders to navigate this transformation, moving from
a state of data paralysis to one of dynamic, AI-driven optimization.

## AI: The Rosetta Stone for IT and OT.

The core problem of industrial connectivity is, at its heart, a problem of
translation. It requires translating the wide spectrum of proprietary and legacy
protocols of OT equipment into modern, open standards that IT systems can
understand. It requires translating the implicit, experience-based knowledge of
a veteran engineer—who can diagnose a machine by its sound—into explicit,
repeatable logic that can be automated. And it requires translating torrents of
raw, cryptic sensor data into meaningful business insights that can drive decisions.

AI is uniquely suited to serve as this "universal translator." Modern AI models, especially when integrated into accessible platforms like FlowFuse, represent a vast, codified repository of human and machine experience. They can be trained to understand and communicate with obscure protocols, to parse complex and non-standard data structures, and even to generate the specific code required to bridge two previously incompatible systems. This capability effectively democratizes decades of accumulated knowledge from the open-source community, domain experts, and system integrators, making it instantly available to any engineer on the shop floor. AI becomes the intelligence layer that can comprehend the diverse "languages" of the factory and translate them into a common tongue.

This approach also directly addresses the industry's most significant resource constraint: the shortage of skilled workers. The fact that "upskilling employees" is the only strategic priority ranked higher than "adopting AI" indicates that any solution requiring the hiring of a large, new workforce of specialist data scientists and programmers is simply not scalable. The most effective AI strategy, therefore, is one that augments the existing workforce. By providing AI-powered tools that handle the complex syntax of programming and integration, manufacturers can empower their OT engineers and IT operatives, the people who already possess deep domain knowledge, to execute the AI strategy themselves. This acts as a "force multiplier" allowing the current workforce to solve the connectivity problem and simultaneously achieve the two highest-ranking strategic priorities for growth.
The challenges posed by disconnected, siloed, or aging industrial assets are formidable, but not insurmountable. Over the past years we’ve seen initial success with Large Language Models (LLMs), a form of AI that takes vast amounts of content and builds a web of associations. AI is rapidly moving from a topic of speculative discussion to a core component of strategic investment. Manufacturers are prioritizing AI as it’s the crucial missing piece; a universal translator across IT and OT systems, and an interface 

According to the 2024 State of Industrial Networking Report, the #1 investment priority for manufacturing firms today is AI-enabled devices. Furthermore, the adoption of AI is the #2 overall strategy for creating growth, second only to the crucial task of upskilling employees. Manufacturers are no longer just experimenting with AI in isolated data science projects; they are actively investing in embedding intelligence directly into their operational infrastructure. As always in manufacturing, ROI drives investments. AI isn’t void of business outcomes. The top drivers for OT investment are fundamental to competitive success: improving efficiency (cited by 35% of firms), increasing production (32%), improving cybersecurity (25%), and achieving cost savings (25%). 

Your Roadmap: The Three-Phase Journey to Data Mastery
To make the adoption of this AI-driven approach manageable and to ensure a clear return on investment, manufacturers should follow a structured, three-phase journey. This roadmap provides a logical progression from establishing a foundational data pipeline to realizing the full value of high-level, intelligent applications.

Phase 1: Connect & Collect: This is the first step of establishing a universal data pipeline and architecture from every asset on the factory floor. The primary objective is universal data acquisition, getting data out of machines regardless of their age, vendor, or communication protocol.
Phase 2: Contextualize & Normalize: This is the crucial middle step of transforming the raw, disparate streams of data into a single, standardized, and context-rich format. The objective is to create a single source of truth by cleaning the data, standardizing its format, and enriching it with vital operational context.
Phase 3: Visualize & Interact: This is the final, value-realization phase where the unified, contextualized data is made accessible and actionable. The objective is to accelerate the decision-making loop by enabling teams to explore, analyze, and act upon the data through intelligent dashboards, conversational interfaces, and advanced AI-driven applications.
This three-phase journey provides a clear and methodical path for manufacturers to move from a state of data paralysis to one of dynamic, AI-driven operational excellence.
