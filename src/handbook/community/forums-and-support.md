## FlowFuse Support and Forums

### Introduction

We provide a comprehensive support and community platform for FlowFuse users, developers, and enthusiasts. Our forums and support resources are designed to empower you with the knowledge, assistance, and collaboration you need to make the most out of FlowFuse and Node-RED.

At FlowFuse, we believe in fostering a community that is not only knowledgeable but also supportive and inclusive. We encourage you to explore our [Community Guidelines](./community-guidelines/) to understand how you can contribute positively to this dynamic ecosystem.

### Forums

The FlowFuse forums are key places for discussions, problem-solving, and community support. To ensure productive and respectful interactions, community members should adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Stay On Topic**: Keep your posts relevant to the discussion topic. If you have a new question or issue, start a new thread rather than diverting an existing one.
- **Use Clear Titles**: Make your thread titles clear and descriptive to help others understand the topic at a glance.
- **Provide Details**: When asking for help, provide as much detail as possible about your issue, including flows, error messages, and steps to reproduce the problem.
- **Search Before Posting**: Before starting a new thread, use the search functionality to see if your question has already been answered. This helps keep the forum organized and reduces duplicate posts.
- **Follow Up**: If you receive help, follow up to let others know if the solution worked or if you need further assistance. This feedback helps improve the community knowledge base.
