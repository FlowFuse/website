## Node-RED is FlowFuse

We strongly encourage the belief that there is no difference between the Node-RED and FlowFuse communities. As a member of both communities and an employee of FlowFuse, you should treat all community members equally. Remember, the success of FlowFuse lies in the success of Node-RED.

### General Guidelines

- **Respect and Inclusivity:** Treat everyone with respect. Discrimination or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. Strive to create a welcoming environment for all, regardless of experience level, background, or personal characteristics.

- **Constructive Communication:** Engage in constructive and positive discussions. Offer help and feedback in a supportive manner, and be open to receiving the same from others. Avoid personal attacks and negative remarks.

- **Collaboration and Sharing:** Encourage collaboration and the sharing of knowledge. The strength of our community lies in our collective expertise and willingness to help one another. Share your flows, solutions, and ideas openly.
