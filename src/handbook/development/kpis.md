# KPIs

## Engineering Throughput

Engineering throughput is a measure of how much value we're able to deliver to our customers. It's calculated by summing the total number of Pull Requests merged in a given time frame across the following repositories:

- [FlowFuse](https://github.com/flowfuse/flowfuse)
- [Node-RED](https://github.com/node-red/node-red)
- [Node-RED Dashboard 2.0](https://github.com/flowfuse/node-red-dashboard)
- [Node-RED Launcher](https://github.com/flowfuse/node-red-launcher)

An interactive Dashboard for these metrics, and a breakdown of the specifics issues and Pull Requests involved can be found [here](https://github-stats.flowfuse.cloud/dashboard/analysis)
