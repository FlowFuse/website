# Support

## Support Tickets 

Support tickets can be opened via the [FlowFuse Support Portal](/support). FlowFuse employees will be notified of support ticket and chat traffic via the [FlowFuse Support Slack channel](https://flowforgeworkspace.slack.com/archives/C031K13FLDD).

## SLAs

For all FlowFuse customers, we have an [SLA](/handbook/sales/subscription-agreement-1.5) defined as part of the Subscription Agreement. Initial responses to support tickets must be sent within the SLA time frame defined in the Subscription Agreement.

## Triage Duty

For guidance on monitoring incoming tickets and routing them to the right person, see the [Triage Duty](triage.md) guide.

## Troubleshooting

When trying to decipher a support ticket, you can follow the guides provided in the [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) section of the handbook.
