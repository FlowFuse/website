# Support Triage Duty

## Overview

Support triage duty is a first-line monitoring role to ensure incoming support requests are promptly categorized and routed to the right person. The goal is not to solve every issue yourself, but to make sure nothing falls through the cracks and customers receive timely responses. To keep every department connected to our users and share the support load, we are moving to a Full Company Triage Rotation starting on Feb 9th.

## The Why

Historically, HubSpot triage was a collection of miscellaneous tickets with no formal caregiver, making it difficult to track department-specific needs. Departments checked in as needed, but there was a risk of technical, sales, and marketing questions falling through the cracks. To ensure a successful and fair triage role, we are moving to a Full Company Rotation to ensure every ticket gets a clear onward journey.

## The Flow: How it works

- **The Schedule**: Each Friday, the Support Coordinator will name the next Triage Lead in #support-tickets in Slack to confirm who is on duty for the week ahead.
- **The Shift**: Your rotation lasts one week (Monday to Friday).
- **The Goal**: You aren't expected to solve every technical issue. Your job is to identify, label, and route the ticket so it gets to the right human.

### Weekly Responsibilities

- **Monitor HubSpot**: Check the [Unassigned Triage](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/help-desk/26586079/view/236761036/list-view) view daily. 
- **Tag & Route**: Categorize tickets based on the handbook guidelines.
- **Communicate**: Ping the relevant team in Slack if a ticket is urgent.

### Vacation & OOO

The Support Coordinator will cross-reference the rotation with Deel each week to identify OOO conflicts and proactively swap any unavailable team members with an active colleague.

## Where Tickets Come From

- **Live chat** from the support widget on the website
- **Emails** sent to support@flowfuse.com

Both appear in the [HubSpot helpdesk](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/help-desk/26586079/). For detailed HubSpot procedures, see the [Support Tickets section](/handbook/sales/customer-success/#support-tickets) of Customer Success.

## Monitoring

- **HubSpot**: Keep the helpdesk open in a browser tab
- **Slack**: New tickets trigger a notification in [#support-tickets](https://flowfuse.slack.com/archives/C031K13FLDD)
  - **Note**: To get badge notifications (like mentions) for this channel, configure it in the channel's notification preferences—not just the bell icon button

## Slack Emoji Reactions

When you see a ticket notification in [#support-tickets](https://flowfuse.slack.com/archives/C031K13FLDD), use emoji reactions to indicate status:

- 👀 (`:eyes:`) - You're on it
- ✅ (`:white_check_mark:`) - Issue has been dealt with

This helps the team quickly see which tickets are being handled without cluttering the channel with status messages.

## Triage Categories

When a new ticket comes in, categorize it, answer the question directly, or route accordingly. Some initial guidance:

| Category | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Sales inquiry | Route to [#dept-sales](https://flowfuse.slack.com/archives/C05GYH95NJZ) team |
| Billing inquiry | Route to DRI for Finance |
| Product support | Route to [#dept-engineering](https://flowfuse.slack.com/archives/C032Q63FGG1) team |
| Spam (e.g., booth design offers) | Close ticket without responding, delete Slack notification |

## Key Points

- **Check the content carefully**: Sales team members sometimes email support on behalf of customers. The "from" address may be internal, but the request is for a customer.
- **Ticket ownership**: Whoever replies first becomes the ticket owner and receives future notifications for that ticket.
- **Already assigned tickets**: If a ticket already has an owner, you don't need to intervene—unless it's been unresponded for 24+ hours, then give the owner a nudge.
- **When unsure**: Ask in #engineering or #support-tickets for guidance.
- **Do NOT merge tickets in HubSpot**: Merged tickets become unsearchable and disappear from the inbox. They're only accessible via direct URL afterward. This is a [known HubSpot limitation](https://community.hubspot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Search-the-MERGED-Ticket-Data/idi-p/330641). Keep tickets separate to maintain searchability and visibility.

## Handling Spam

Common spam includes booth design offers and unsolicited sales pitches. 

For these, click "Mark as spam" in the orange "Actions" dropdown located top-right.  They will disappear from the ticket list after a short while, but you can also simply delete the ticket.
