# Tools

## GitHub

This is at the heart of how we work. Everyone in the company will be made part of
the [FlowFuse organisation](https://github.com/FlowFuse) as part of their on-boarding
activities.

## LLM Programming assists

FlowFuse recognizes the potential of LLM (AI) tools to increase productivity and
innovation. When using these tools, understand that the author and committer of
any work remains fully responsible for its quality, functionality, and
security. AI-assisted work must meet the same high standards as work written
entirely by a human. Review each line of code before committing.

When using AI tools for development, never share:
1. Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
2. Company secrets like API keys, private credentials, etc, etc.
3. Customer code or other assets under NDA

### GitHub Copilot

We do not currently provide organisation-wide licenses for GitHub Copilot, but if
team members wish to purchase an individual license they can do so via their Brex
card and expense the cost.

As it stands, some of the team already have Copilot access via their Open Source work
at no cost. To enable it at the organisation level will cost almost twice that of
individual access; and currently the benefits do not justify that increased cost.

We will keep this under review - if you feel we are missing out by not having
the organisation level access, please speak to the CTO.
