# Tools

## GitHub

This is at the heart of how we work. Everyone in the company will be made part of
the [FlowFuse organization](https://github.com/FlowFuse) as part of their on-boarding
activities.

## LLM Programming assists

FlowFuse recognizes the potential of LLM (AI) tools to increase productivity and
innovation. When using these tools, understand that the author and committer of
any work remains fully responsible for its quality, functionality, and
security. AI-assisted work must meet the same high standards as work written
entirely by a human. Review each line of code before committing.

When using AI tools for development, never share:
1. Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
2. Company secrets like API keys, private credentials, etc, etc.
3. Customer code or other assets under NDA

### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot Business is available to team members by raising an [access request issue](https://github.com/FlowFuse/admin/issues/new?template=access-request.md) and assigning it to the CTO.

Alternatively, individuals can self-purchase Copilot Pro/+ and expense the cost, or qualify for free access due to their role as an Open Source maintainer.
