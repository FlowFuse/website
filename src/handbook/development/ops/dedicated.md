# FlowFuse Dedicated

FlowFuse Dedicated is our product offering where we will host a dedicated instance
of the platform for a customer.

This is a guide for the setup and delivery of a dedicated instance.

### Pre-deployment

In order to create the dedicated instance, some information will be required from the customer.

 - **A domain name to host the platform on**. The core platform (`forge.`), broker (`mqtt.`) and
   hosted instances will be made available under this domain.
   The customer will need to setup the DNS entry for this domain to point at the AWS Route53
   end-point.
 - **Choice of AWS region**. We default to `eu-west-1` but customers may want to choose one more
   local to them. Not all AWS regions are equal and we may need to review their choice for suitability.
 - **Capacity planning**. Whilst the platform will scale to meet demand, we want to sure we provision
   it at a suitable level for their intended usage. Understanding their planned usage and growth rate
   will help us pick the right node size for the cluster.
 - **Team/Instance types**. We will default to creating equivalent Team and Instance types as
   we use on FFCloud. If a customer has specific needs in this area, this should be identified prior
   to deployment.
 - **SSO Configuration**. As with FFCloud, if the customer plans to integrate with their SSO provider,
   we will need to capture the necessary information. This can be done after the initial deployment.


### Deployment

An issue should be raised in the CloudProject repository using the Dedicated Checklist template
and assigned to the member of the engineering/ops team who will do the setup.

This checklist covers the follow items:

1. Create a new AWS sub-account for each dedicated env.
2. Create user accounts for the ops team
2. Use Terraform to setup initial cluster
3. Setup grafana monitoring - including all the necessary alerting
4. Setup initial admin account - store details in 1Password
5. Setup initial Stacks, Instance Types and Team Types
6. Setup SSO for customer
7. Create initial account for customer admin user (if weâ€™re giving them admin access)

### Migration

For existing customers of FFCloud who are choosing to move to a FFDedicated environment,
we need to consider how to migrate their existing account. This will need to be considered
on a case-by-case basis in discussion with the customer as there are a number of challenges
around providing a seamless migration.

For example, we cannot migrate access tokens between platforms. This will require devices
to be reprovisioned with new credentials as well as have their `device.yml` updated to point
to the new platform URL.

### Maintenance

We will agree a maintenance policy with the customer to fit their needs. We will require
the code to be kept up to date - the question is how we schedule updates.

#### FlowFuse Code Updates

We can either do CI/CD as we do for FF Cloud, or apply updates following each monthly release.

#### k8s Updates

We will coordinate maintenance windows with the customer for when we need to apply
updates to the underlying k8s infrastructure as this will require restarts of their
Node-RED instances.
