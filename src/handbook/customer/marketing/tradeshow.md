## As visitor

### Preparation before the fair

When visiting a trade show you should prepare your trip. Fairs usually publish a
list of exhibitioners. Scan that list with names you want to visit, and write
these in a document. Than order that list based on stand location. Fairs can
become rather big, and going back and forth over the area doesn't scale. Review
also [the traveling salesperson problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).

Further, please get yourself a few business cards. While a bit old-skool, they
serve a purpose and are easy to give out.

### Stand visits

Each conversation you have and stand you visit, try to understand who you want
to talk to and what your goal is. It's OK to ask someone at the booth if they're
the right person to talk them.

Keep your phone in your pocket at all times, give full attention to the person
you're talking to. Reply to missed messages and calls after you've left the
stand.

When giving out business cards, ask for one back, that way there's a mutual
connection if one side forgets to reach out or loses your business card.

Your phone is kept in your pocket at all times. 

### Post-visit

Go through the business cards you collected and reach out to _each and everyone_
of them. Thank them for the conversation and ask if there's any questions
outstanding you can help them with. Consider adding these contacts to [HubSpot](/handbook/customer/hubspot/).
