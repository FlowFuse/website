# Lead Generation

Lead generation helps expand FlowFuse's user base and drive revenue. By providing useful content, you can convert website visitors to leads for nurturing. Leads also provide a focused audience for marketing efforts, allowing for more effective communication and conversion strategies. Lead generation content includes whitepapers, ebooks, webinar slides, guides etc. 

## Setting up

 - Once the content has been finalized, create a PDF version and upload it to Hubspot (Library -> files).
 - Create a new Form to capture lead information such as name, email, company and title. Add a campaign where relevant. (You can clone an existing form). Set the form submission action to link directly to the PDF or to a thank you page (thank you pages help track conversions in ad campaigns). 
 - Create a Thank you mail which includes the link to the PDf and request to "contact us" for further information/help.
 - Create a workflow to send the email upon form submission and to add the lead to a topic interest group list ([Example](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/workflows/26586079/platform/flow/1472559590/edit).   
 - Add the Form ID to the relevant Website page.
 - Add the Form to the [Content downloads list](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/contacts/26586079/objectLists/322/filters) and create a report for Form submissions for the [content performance dashboard](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/reports-dashboard/26586079/view/107434040) for tracking purposes. 



# Trade show

## As exhibitor

### Booth design

The design of the booth is imporant. From the angles that visitors walk past the
booth it's vital to have the main logo's in sight: FlowFuse and Node-RED. If the
space is large enough, ensure an interactive element is added to the booth for
visitors to use and get an idea of what FlowFuse offers.

## As visitor

### Preparation before the fair

When visiting a trade show you should prepare your trip. Fairs usually publish a
list of exhibitioners. Scan that list with names you want to visit, and write
these in a document. Than order that list based on stand location. Fairs can
become rather big, and going back and forth over the area doesn't scale. Review
also [the traveling salesperson problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).

Further, please get yourself a few business cards. While a bit old-skool, they
serve a purpose and are easy to give out.

### Stand visits

Each conversation you have and stand you visit, try to understand who you want
to talk to and what your goal is. It's OK to ask someone at the booth if they're
the right person to talk them.

Keep your phone in your pocket at all times, give full attention to the person
you're talking to. Reply to missed messages and calls after you've left the
stand.

When giving out business cards, ask for one back, that way there's a mutual
connection if one side forgets to reach out or loses your business card.

Your phone is kept in your pocket at all times. 

### Post-visit

Go through the business cards you collected and reach out to _each and everyone_
of them. Thank them for the conversation and ask if there's any questions
outstanding you can help them with. Consider adding these contacts to [HubSpot](/handbook/customer/hubspot/).
