# {{ navTitle }}

Clear and consistent messaging serves as a cornerstone for our company to
achieve growth and a bigger market presence. The messaging framework is
essential for the company to communicate its value, purpose, and
differentiation, to in turn effectively acquire and retain our customer base.

Consistency of messaging is important; with our growing company we’ve got
limited resources and thus it’s imperative to make a significant impact quickly.
If that fails, the company must learn quickly and iterate. When the messaging is
consistent the company can learn faster and have a structured approach to these
iterations.

For guidance on how to express our brand in writing and communication style, see
[Brand Personality, Tone of Voice & Character](/handbook/customer/marketing/brand-voice/)

Please also read the
[Company Mission](/handbook/company/strategy/#flowfuse%27s-mission) before
diving into the messaging.

## Audience

FlowFuse is a business to business (B2B) company in the industrial markets to
innovate with software through low-code development. The end user is a skilled
worker, but not always skilled in automation through software.

FlowFuse often sells to IT teams that want to enable the OT teams to participate
in digital solution building.

FlowFuse focusses on the engineer for messaging, this is due to the adoption of
our software being grass-roots.

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

FlowFuse appeals to a broad range of customers, many of which do not fall into
our 'ICP'. That's not to say FlowFuse shouldn't cater to this audience, but does

1. Manufacturing or industrial company
   1. Tier 1: Automotive, Pharma, Renewable energy
   1. Tier 2: Electronics, Semiconductor, Chemical, Oil & Gas
   1. Tier 3: Food & Beverage, Mining, Water & Wastewater
1. Greater than $500 million in annual revenue. The need to have sufficiently
   large budgets to purchase FlowFuse.
1. Greater than 500 employees. The company needs to be large enough to have
   internal IT and/or OT people on staff.
1. Node-RED interested
1. Established Digitalization strategy

### Prospect Stages (Node-RED Awareness)

When considering messaging, sales conversations and how we communicate our value
as a product and company, wan important factor for us at this stage is how aware
of Node-RED the prospect/customer is.

We classify a customer into one of five "stages":

- **Stage 0: Unaware of Node-RED** No knowledge of Node-RED and what is does
- **Stage 1: Node-RED Discovery** Aware of what Node-RED is, and may have
  dabbled with it a little, without using it in-depth
- **Stage 2: Value of Node-RED** User has used Node-RED in their own personal
  projects, or for professional proof-of-concepts
- **Stage 3: Node-RED in Production** Person has built and deployed Node-RED in
  a professional, production, environment
- **Stage 4: Node-RED at Scale** User has over 5 x Node-RED instances running in
  a production environment

Independent of the stage a customer is at, we need to ensure we have consistent
messaging around the value of FlowFuse, but be aware of other value (e.g. the
pure value of Node-RED) which can still be factored into the conversation.

### About FlowFuse - 150 Words

For industrial companies, competition is more intense than ever. Achieving
growth targets while maintaining profits takes continuous commitment to process
improvement. But to innovate, your team needs seamless access to data, and the
ability to rapidly build applications that can transform data into operational
insights. The faster your team can collect and transform data directly from your
operations, the faster you can make process adjustments that create true
business value and profit.

FlowFuse is the leading open source platform for building and operating
self-built industrial data solutions that digitalize processes and operations.
The platform leverages Node-RED, a low-code programming technology that makes it
easy for your OT-engineers to quickly connect, collect, transform, and visualize
data for interacting with industrial processes. Node-RED seamlessly integrates
with thousands of industrial devices and 100s of protocols and data services.

Founded in 2021 by Nick O’Leary, co-creator of Node-RED, companies use FlowFuse
to manage, scale and secure their industrial Node-RED solutions.

## FlowFuse's Definition

Built on the simplicity of Node-RED, FlowFuse adds the tools teams need to scale
automation workflows with confidence. FlowFuse is a platform that helps
organizations build and manage powerful low-code data applications using
Node-RED. We make it easy to connect systems, automate processes, and build
industrial or digital solutions — all while giving IT teams the control,
security, and scalability they need. Whether you’re an engineer, a developer, or
a company scaling up operations, FlowFuse bridges the gap between innovation and
reliability.

## FlowFuse in-depth

FlowFuse is a software platform that helps companies manage and scale
applications built with Node-RED, a popular visual programming tool used to
automate tasks and connect systems. While Node-RED allows users to quickly
create powerful applications by wiring together different building blocks, it
becomes difficult to manage once used across many devices, teams, or
environments. That’s where FlowFuse comes in.

FlowFuse adds the structure, tools, and safety needed to use Node-RED in
professional and industrial settings. It allows companies to organize and
control multiple Node-RED instances, whether they’re running on the cloud or on
physical machines like factory equipment. With FlowFuse, users can develop
applications, test them safely, and deploy them to different environments
without fear of breaking things. Teams can work together more effectively thanks
to user access controls, audit logs, and centralized monitoring. It supports
both SaaS and self-hosted models, so companies can keep full control when
needed, especially in industries with strict security or privacy requirements.

Ultimately, FlowFuse transforms the speed and flexibility of Node-RED into
something reliable, scalable, and secure — making it suitable not just for
individual developers or hobbyists, but for entire organizations running
critical systems. It gives companies the confidence to innovate quickly while
staying in control.
