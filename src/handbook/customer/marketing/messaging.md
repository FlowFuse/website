## Audience

FlowFuse is a business to business (B2B) company in the industrial markets to
innovate with software through low-code development. The end user is a skilled
worker, but not always skilled in automation through software.

FlowFuse often sells to IT teams that want to enable the OT teams to participate
in digital solution building.

FlowFuse focusses on the engineer for messaging, this is due to the adoption of
our software being grass-roots.

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

FlowFuse appeals to a broad range of customers, many of which do not fall into
our 'ICP'. That's not to say FlowFuse shouldn't cater to this audience, but
does 

1. Manufacturing or industrial company
1. $500MM or up in revenue
1. At least a 3 man IT team
1. Node-RED interested
1. Established Digitalization strategy

### Prospect Stages (Node-RED Awareness)

When considering messaging, sales conversations and how we communicate our value as
a product and company, wan important factor for us at this stage is how aware of
Node-RED the prospect/customer is.

We classify a customer into one of five "stages":

- **Stage 0:** No awareness of Node-RED
- **Stage 1:** Aware of what Node-RED is, and may have dabbled with it a little
- **Stage 2:** Aware of Node-RED, and convinced of the Node-RED "wow" factor
- **Stage 3:** Person has built and deployed Node-RED at scale
- **Stage 4:** User has experienced the friction/pain-points around deploying
and managing Node-RED at scale, in a production environment.

Independent of the stage a customer is at, we need to ensure we have consistent
messaging around the value of FlowFuse, but be aware of other value (e.g. the
pure value of Node-RED) which can still be factored into the conversation.
