# {{ navTitle }}

Clear and consistent messaging serves as a cornerstone for our company to achieve
growth and a bigger market presence. The messaging framework is essential for the
company to communicate its value, purpose, and differentiation, to in turn
effectively acquire and retain our customer base.

Consistency of messaging is important; with our growing company we’ve got limited
resources and thus it’s imperative to make a significant impact quickly. If that
fails, the company must learn quickly and iterate. When the messaging is
consistent the company can learn faster and have a structured approach to these
iterations.

Please also read the [Company Mission](/handbook/company/strategy/#flowfuse%27s-mission)
before diving into the messaging.

## Audience

FlowFuse is a business to business (B2B) company in the industrial markets to
innovate with software through low-code development. The end user is a skilled
worker, but not always skilled in automation through software.

FlowFuse often sells to IT teams that want to enable the OT teams to participate
in digital solution building.

FlowFuse focusses on the engineer for messaging, this is due to the adoption of
our software being grass-roots.

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

FlowFuse appeals to a broad range of customers, many of which do not fall into
our 'ICP'. That's not to say FlowFuse shouldn't cater to this audience, but
does 

1. Manufacturing or industrial company
1. $500MM or up in revenue
1. At least a 3 man IT team
1. Node-RED interested
1. Established Digitalization strategy

### Prospect Stages (Node-RED Awareness)

When considering messaging, sales conversations and how we communicate our value as
a product and company, wan important factor for us at this stage is how aware of
Node-RED the prospect/customer is.

We classify a customer into one of five "stages":

- **Stage 0: Unaware of Node-RED** No knowledge of Node-RED and what is does
- **Stage 1: Node-RED Discovery** Aware of what Node-RED is, and may have dabbled with it a little, without using it in-depth
- **Stage 2: Value of Node-RED** User has used Node-RED in their own personal projects,  or for professional proof-of-concepts
- **Stage 3: Node-RED in Production** Person has built and deployed Node-RED in a professional, production, environment
- **Stage 4: Node-RED at Scale** User has over 5 x Node-RED instances running in a production environment

Independent of the stage a customer is at, we need to ensure we have consistent
messaging around the value of FlowFuse, but be aware of other value (e.g. the
pure value of Node-RED) which can still be factored into the conversation.
