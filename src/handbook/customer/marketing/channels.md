## Channel Content Guidance

### Blog

Content should be eloquent and an appropriate length to communicate the message.

### Mailing List

Content should be eloquent and an appropriate length to communicate the message.

### Twitter

Keep it short, Tweets should be factual, informal and have a call to action (a link) where a user can read more.

### Youtube

Videos should:

- Include opening and closing idents.
- Be clear in what they are communicating.
- Have an appropriate thumbnail.
- Have a call to action in the description.
- Be publicly listed.

### LinkedIn

Posts should be framed in the context of FlowFuse as an organisation and a team, don't get too technical. A relevant photo or image should be included in every post. Where the post is primarily of a video it should be embedded from Youtube. Where possible include the content in the post rather than linking out to external content.

### Reddit

Keep it short, Reddit posts should be factual, informal and have a call to action (a link) where a user can read more. If the content is a video we should post that directly on Reddit as that should result in greater interaction.

### Node-RED Slack (FlowFuse section)

Keep it short, Slack messages should be factual, informal and have a call to action (a link) where a user can read more.

### Discourse (Node-RED Forums)

Keep content short, posts to the Node-RED discord should be factual, informal and have a call to action (a link) where a user can read more.
