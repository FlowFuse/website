# Marketing

## What we all do

We're the team that promotes our company and product of FlowFuse to the core audience
of FlowFuse. This includes:
1. Generating brand awareness.
1. Publishing high-quality content such as blog posts, video, and infographics.
1. Engaging with the Node-RED and nascent FlowFuse communities
1. Event planning, such as [trade shows](/handbook/customer/marketing/tradeshow/)
1. Growth hacking; always be innovating when finding the audience and engaging with
them in a cost effective way.

The ultimate goal for the department is to generate MQLs for the
sales team or sign-ups for [FlowFuse Cloud](https://app.flowfuse.com).
