Each content type has channels which are appropriate, this table sets out which content should be posted on each channel, but always mindful of the topic of the content. We should share content relevant to the each channel audience.

    - There are placeholder posts in the form of drafts.
    - Clone them to be able to create a new post adressed to all social channels at once.
    - The draft includes the type of content to be shared on the given date and time, and structure recomendations for the description.
    - When posting content on Facebook, always share to the relevant groups too.
    - We'll add a placeholder for youtube, but this needs to be shared from the Youtube platform and not HubSpot.
- **Posting hours:** USA Easter Time break and before work hours, trying to coincide with Germany lunch and after work hours.
    - USA before work (6:00 am EDT - 12 pm CEST).
