# Social Media Channels

Each content type has channels which are appropriate, this table sets out which content should be posted on each channel, but always mindful of the topic of the content. We should share content relevant to the each channel audience.

## Strategy for increasing reach

- Share quality content aligned with the [company strategy](/handbook/company/strategy/) and of interest to our [personas](/handbook/product/personas/#personas) and [ideal customer profile](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1krMIUJvosw8xUQog_iq_FEvI9R5WEo9ZyWUCdTb9XnQ/edit#heading=h.3rr2wuny55dl).

#### Planning and posting

- We'll plan **two weeks ahead**, to give us time to prepare content and the associated materials.
- We'll keep the planning on our [HubSpot social calendar](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/social/26586079/manage/calendar).
    - There are placeholder posts in the form of drafts.
    - Clone them to be able to create a new post adressed to all social channels at once.
    - The draft includes the type of content to be shared on the given date and time, and structure recomendations for the description.
    - When posting content on Facebook, always share to the relevant groups too.
    - We'll add a placeholder for Youtube, but this needs to be shared from the Youtube platform and not HubSpot.
- **Posting hours:** Aligned with USA Eastern Time before work hours and during lunch, aiming to coincide with Germany's lunch and after work hours.
    - USA before work (6:00 am EDT - 12 pm CEST).
    - USA lunch hours (11:30 am EDT -  5:30 pm CEST).
- While we have a planned schedule, it's crucial to remain flexible. If more impactful or relevant content emerges, we'll adapt our plan accordingly to ensure the best possible engagement.

#### Posts format

- Descriptive text: 
    - Align with post purpose and audience goals.
    - Think about relevance to the audience.
- Emoji
