# Self Hosted Dashboard v2 Multi User Plugin

In order to make use of the Dashboard v2 multi user plugin, self 
hosted Enterprise customer will need a NPM authentication token 
to allow them to download and install the plugin.

When a customer requests a authentication token raise an issue on
[node-red-dashboard-ff-auth](https://github.com/FlowFuse/node-red-dashboard-ff-auth)
project using the template provided. A member of the engineering 
team with suitable npm access will then create a new token and 
record the details in the gsheet 
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EZ3FAM9bjQd0yvlc6cn_yueRGIKoMeOcFxQSDxztb48/edit#gid=0).

The key should be emailed to the customer along with 
link to the documentation on how to deploy the token which can be 
found [here](https://flowfuse.com/docs/upgrade/open-source-to-premium)
