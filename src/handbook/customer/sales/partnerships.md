# Partnerships

FlowFuse engages with both hardware parters and referral partners. Here are [our standard terms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BVls7LEC1CBQ6wlrb8GeWSYr2vj9fMqgdsWiWLoQZOY/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs).

When there's interest in becoming a partner FlowFuse requires a project to colaborate on jointly.
Implementation projects structure the partnership and learning on both sides.

Please [contact us](https://flowfuse.com/partners/) to discuss and complete an agreement.
