</p>
<p>

To the extent Personal Data from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom and Switzerland are processed by FlowFuse, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall apply, as further set forth in the DPA.

Customer further acknowledges that the Software and related features are not intended to meet any legal obligations for these uses, including HIPAA and GLBA requirements, and that FlowFuse is not a Business Associate as defined under HIPAA. Therefore, notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, FlowFuse has no liability for Sensitive Data processed in connection with Customer’s use of the Software.

<h2><strong>APPENDIX 2: Software as a Service (SaaS) Offering</strong></h2>


<p>
With respect to Customer’s purchase and/or use of the SaaS Software, the following additional terms shall apply.
</p>
<h4><strong>AVAILABILITY</strong></h4>


<p>
Availability to the SaaS Software will be measured, and reported on, by FlowFuse using instrumentation and observation tools specifically designed to provide a representative measure of service availability. Recent status, references to availability measurement definition, and historical reporting will be available at or linked from the FlowFuse system status site located at https://status.flowfuse.com/.
</p>
<h4><strong>RESILIENCY</strong></h4>


<p>
FlowFuse will architect and maintain an underlying cloud infrastructure with commercially reasonable resiliency for all data, compute, and network services. At a minimum, FlowFuse will maintain the highest documented level of “FlowFuse Reference Architecture” as detailed at https://flowfuse.com/docs.
</p>
<h4><strong>BACKUPS</strong></h4>


<p>
FlowFuse will maintain a commercially reasonable system of data backup process and technology to ensure that primary data sources remain recoverable in the event of various system failures.
</p>
<h4><strong>MONITORING AND INCIDENT RESPONSE</strong></h4>


<p>
FlowFuse will employ a system of instrumentation and observation tools to ensure that system behavior which may limit use of the SaaS Software is detected and announced. FlowFuse will also employ industry reasonable practices to maintain appropriate engineering personnel availability for the purposes of incident response(s).
</p>
<h4><strong>UPDATES AND UPGRADES</strong></h4>


<p>
FlowFuse will update the SaaS Software as updates are available and when reasonably practical to implement said updates. Update timing and process will remain at FlowFuse’s discretion.
</p>
<h4><strong>SCHEDULED SYSTEM MAINTENANCE</strong></h4>


<p>
FlowFuse will occasionally perform scheduled system maintenance which requires limits to the use of part or all of the SaaS Software features, or significantly reduces features and functions during the scheduled system maintenance period. FlowFuse will provide ten (10) business days notice for all scheduled system maintenance activities. FlowFuse will take a proactive approach to minimizing the need for such maintenance and will limit scheduled system maintenance to less than four (4) hours per calendar month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an emergency or urgent issue which may negatively impact FlowFuse’s customers, FlowFuse has the right to carry out unscheduled maintenance to remedy such instance(s). For the avoidance of doubt, such unscheduled maintenance shall: (i) be limited to only those issues which may negatively impact customers; and (ii) will be carried out in such a manner to provide for the least amount of disruption to customers.
</p>
<h4><strong>SUSPENSION OF SERVICE</strong></h4>


<p>
FlowFuse reserves the right to suspend service to the SaaS Software if: (i) Customer fails to comply with the Agreement and this Appendix, (ii) Customer exceeds set application limits, or (iii) requests or usage deemed malicious in nature is identified to be sourced from Customer accounts, personnel, or systems.
</p>
