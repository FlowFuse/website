## Generating a Quote

Clearly written, easy to understand quotes are crucial for customers to understand what they are purchasing and how much it costs. To create a quote, combine the (1) product plan and (2) other purchased items according to the following guide.

**What to Quote**

When preparing a quote, include both the plan and any extras that go beyond what comes with the plan at the designated tier. Include a note in the Terms section that indicates what comes with the plan. (This will be pre-filled when using one of the HubSpot quote templates). The product plan will be listed as its own line, with a quantity of 1, and the minimum purchase price for that plan. The add-on options should also be added to the product section, as referenced by the purchase term template.

| Item & Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| FlowFuse Enterprise Platform \- Cloud | 1 | $X,000/year | $X,000 |
| Enterprise \- Instance Add-On | 10 | $X,000/year | $X,000 |
| Enterprise \- Remote Device Add-On | 10 | $X,000 | $X,000 |

Annual Subtotal	  $XX,000  
**Total**			  $XX,000

**Creating a Quote**

Follow these steps to create a quote.

1. In HubSpot, open the relevant Deal. In the Quotes area, click Add to begin a new quote.  
2. Fill in the Buyer Information section. This will pre-fill with the information from the contact in the Deal.  
3. The default Quote creator will be you. Change this if necessary.  
4. In the Line Items area, select the appropriate Plan that is being quoted. Set billing to Annual, and adjust fields for Term and discount/fee/tax as needed. Add additional line items only for purchases that exceed features that are included with the Plan.  
5. Set Signature and Payment settings as needed.  
6. In the Template and Details section, choose the appropriate Quote Template from the dropdown menu. Choosing the correct Quote Template is important because it will pre-fill the correct plan features onto the quote. You can include additional Comments to Buyer or Purchase Terms here. They will not overwrite the Terms and Comments included with the Quote Template.  
7. Review your Quote, and when everything is correct, click Create to create the quote attached to the relevant Deal.

## Closing a deal

A deal is considered closed when all the outlines steps below are completed.
Starting the closing process can commence when the customer has legally
committed to purchase our products or services. This commitment must be
evidenced by one of the following:

* **Receipt of a Customer Purchase Order (PO)**: A document issued by the customer, authorizing the purchase of specified goods or services at a specified price.
* **Signed Company Quote**: A formal, written quotation provided by our company, which has been duly signed, indicating their acceptance of the terms and conditions outlined therein.

Important Note: Verbal agreements, informal emails, or other non-binding expressions of interest do not constitute a closed deal. The legal commitment, as evidenced by a PO or signed quote, is the sole determinant.
