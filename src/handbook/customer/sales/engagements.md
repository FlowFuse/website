# Engagements

FlowFuse has two commercial offerings; self-managed and FlowFuse Cloud. How we
engage with customers will differentiate based on the install method and size of
the opportunity.

## Generating a Quote and Order Form

Quotes are generated through HubSpot. Each quote should link to the subsciption
agreement as well as include "Order Form" in the description. Link the latest
version of the document with the [subscription agreement](/handbook/customer/sales/legal/#subscription-agreement).

## Closing a deal

Follow the steps below to ensure every new customer is setup for success and
quickly as possible following a sale. A deal is considered closed when the
customer signed the order form or quote. You do not need to wait for 
countersignature.
