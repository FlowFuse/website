navTitle: Discovery Meeting
---

The goal of the discovery call is to get to know the prospective client and the
problem that FlowFuse may be able to help them.

FlowFuse will use the "Discovery Call Playbook" in Hubspot, [Learn how to use
playbooks](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/playbooks/use-playbooks#use-playbooks-in-contact-company-deal-ticket-or-custom-crm-records).

The next step depends on the outcome of the call, but usually results in a more technical discussion, product demonstration, or sending relevant content to follow-up on at an appropriate time in the future.
