navTitle: Sales Meetings
---

To understand the prospective customers needs and how FlowFuse can help a process
has been created to enhance their experience. Almost all engagements with customers
are on virtual sites, generally Google Meet.

## Meeting a customer

For internal training purposes all sales calls should be recorded after getting
explicit consent from the customer. On request of the customer, the recording
will be shared.

The organizer of the meeting should perform pre-call preparation, including
research on the prospective customer, any goals they have shared, any goals we
have, and any relevant background information so all FlowFuse participants can
know what to expect.

For each meeting, be 2 minutes early. This allows everyone to check their setup
and sync up what the goals are for the meeting.

## Meeting structure

The number of times FlowFuse will meet with a customer depends mostly on the
customer. However, in all cases FlowFuse would like to have an initial
[Discovery Call](/handbook/customer/sales/meetings/discovery/).

A discovery call is generally followed by a [Demo](/handbook/customer/sales/meetings/demo/). 

To validate the solution to the problem the customer is experiencing, FlowFuse will
aid in a [POC](/handbook/customer/sales/meetings/poc/).
