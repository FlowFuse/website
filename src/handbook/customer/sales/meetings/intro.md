navTitle: Intro Meeting - Sales
---

The goal of the introductory call is to get to know the prospective client and how FlowFuse may be able to help them.

These [qualifying questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sOQU57P7ESkTI4_PC3gbmImUPQh3LKZMvGwAkb5UZFw/edit) should be used as a rough guide to determine their use case, timeline, and other important aspects.

The next step depends on the outcome of the call, but usually results in a more technical discussion, product demonstration, or sending relevant content to follow-up on at an appropriate time in the future.
