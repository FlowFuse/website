navTitle: Intro Meeting - Sales
---

The goal of the introductory call is to get to know the prospective client and how FlowFuse may be able to help them.

These qualifying questions should be used as a rough guide to determine the use case, importance of Node-RED, and timeline.

- Is there a NR use case?
- Is NR used in production?
- Is there a timeline within the next 6 months?

The next step depends on the outcome of the call, but usually results in a more technical discussion, product demonstration, or sending relevant content to follow-up on at an appropriate time in the future.
