## Board meetings

Scheduled over a month in advance, these meetings occur roughly every six weeks, reflecting a cadence designed for focused, high-impact engagement.
To balance the high cadence, board meetings are only scheduled for an hour.

### Prewatch

Three business days before the meeting, the CEO will send a 5-10 minute prewatch video giving Board Members an overview of the metrics and topics for discussion. 
In most circumstances a 5-10 min prewatch can help make the time together even more productive, as you get to move contextualizing to before-the-meeting and it gives people time to let things bake in their head, improving the quality of conversation.

### Structure

The 60 minutes of each meeting are structured in the following time blocks:

* 10 minutes Metrics and Company Performance - The company presents key metrics, comparing against the plan and updates projections. The figures will be distributed well in advance, and as such the discussion should be focussed on the reflections of the numbers.
* 40 minutes Strategic Discussion - A comprehensive pre-read document is distributed to all board members and designated observers a week prior to the meeting. This pre-read is mandatory, ensuring that all participants arrive prepared to engage in a productive, informed discussion.
* 10 minutes "Any other business" - Providing an open forum for board members and observers to raise additional topics, propose motions, or conduct votes, such as those related to stock options or other pertinent matters. It would be highly appreciated if topics to be discussed are shared in advance with the rest of the board.

### Board Deck

FlowFuse provides a board deck with high level business overview items, the inspiration for slides is [taken from this template](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/senovo-board-meeting-template/128164697). The template is updated to fit the FlowFuse business.

### Post meeting action items

Within a week after the board meeting, the CEO will distribute assets related to the board meeting.

Assets will always include:
1. A link to the final board deck with metrics in the shared Google Drive
2. A link to the final pre-read for the Strategic Discussion
3. List of action items
