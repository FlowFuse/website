## Board meetings

While prior to July 2025, Board Meetings were for 1 hour every eight weeks, we are migrating to a more typical Board Meeting Cadence with 4 official 90-minute meetings per year (once per quarter) about 1 month after the quarter closes, interspersed with 4 60-minute informal meetings that are focused on metrics and cover one strategic topic for a deep dive. 

## Calendar invites

Since some of the folks invited alternate meetings they attend, we have two sequences of invites scheduled to recur at 26 weeks (instead of one sequence at 13 weeks). This is important to note since this means that if you want to link something in the meeting invite (e.g. a doc or slides), it must be edited in two places. This is more reasonable than manually adding folks to the meeting in alternating succession.

Calendar invites include all the folks expected to be at the board meeting, including our legal counsel. 

## The Meeting

### Prewatch

Three business days before the meeting, the CEO will send a 5-10 minute prewatch video giving Board Members an overview of the metrics and topics for discussion. Since meetings are generally scheduled for Tuesdays, this means the prewatch needs to go out on Fridays. 

In most circumstances a 5-10 min prewatch can help make the time together even more productive, as you get to move contextualizing to before-the-meeting and it gives people time to let things bake in their head, improving the quality of conversation.

In the email where we send the pre-watch, we should also include the key metrics in the text of the email. 

### Structure

The 90 minutes of each meeting are structured in the following time blocks:

* 15 minutes Metrics and Company Performance - The company presents key metrics, comparing against the plan and updates projections. The figures will be distributed well in advance, and as such the discussion should be focussed on the reflections of the numbers.
* 60 minutes Strategic Discussion - In the Strategic Discussion portion, we will focus on one or two (but no more) key topics of focus for the business for discussion. Prior context is shared through the prewatch.
* 15 minutes "Any other business" - Providing an open forum for board members and observers to raise additional topics, propose motions, or conduct votes, such as those related to stock options or other pertinent matters. It would be highly appreciated if topics to be discussed are shared in advance with the rest of the board.

It is the CEO's responsibility to manage time in the meeting.

### Board Deck

FlowFuse provides a board deck with high level business overview items, the inspiration for slides is [taken from this template](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/senovo-board-meeting-template/128164697). The template is updated to fit the FlowFuse business. 

Slides are stored in the "Investors" folder in the "FlowFuse Admin" Shared Drive. 

### Post meeting action items

Within a week after the board meeting, the CEO will distribute assets related to the board meeting.

Assets will always include:
1. A link to the final board deck with metrics in the shared Google Drive
2. A link to the pre-shared materials for the Strategic Discussion
