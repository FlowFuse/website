# Principles

## All Remote

We are a fully remote company that puts a strong emphasis on trust and respect
for its employees, customers, partners, and communities. We are able to hire the
right people from wherever they are in the world. We work openly with one
another and value clear communication and decision making without being sat in
the same room.

## Open Source Stewardship

We believe strongly that Open Source lives at the heart of everything we do. 
Ever since Node-RED was published as  an Open Source project, we have taken
great care to stay true to that principle.

Node-RED has an open governance model which means everyone has a seat at the
table. We will continue to champion that model and work with the community to
ensure anyone who wants to contribute to the project is able to.

## ESG Policy

We believe that integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles
into our core operations is the right thing to do and also fundamental to our success.

Our environmental focus is on minimizing our footprint through efficient
resource management, promoting sustainable practices within our operations, and
our supply chain.

We are committed to ethical interactions and ensuring our products/services contribute positively.
We maintain a [Code of Conduct](/handbook/peopleops/code-of-conduct/) that
outlines our expectations for behavior and interaction within our company and community.

We maintain strong governance through our Board of Directors and comprehensive company policies. Our [board meetings](/handbook/company/board/)
follow a structured approach to provide oversight and strategic direction. We have established clear policies around
[security](/handbook/company/security/), [operations](/handbook/company/security/operations-security/),
[human resources[(/handbook/company/security/human-resources/), and 
[third-party risk management](/handbook/company/security/third-party-risk-management/)
to ensure proper controls and accountability across the organization.
