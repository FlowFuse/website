# Principles

## All Remote

We are a fully remote company that puts a strong emphasis on trust and respect
for its employees, customers, partners, and communities. We are able to hire the
right people from wherever they are in the world. We work openly with one
another and value clear communication and decision making without being sat in
the same room.

## Open Source Stewardship

We believe strongly that Open Source lives at the heart of everything we do. 
Ever since Node-RED was published as  an Open Source project, we have taken
great care to stay true to that principle.

Node-RED has an open governance model which means everyone has a seat at the
table. We will continue to champion that model and work with the community to
ensure anyone who wants to contribute to the project is able to.
