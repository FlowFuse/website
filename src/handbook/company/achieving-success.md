# Achieving Success at FlowForge

## KPI

At FlowForge we're engaged in many initiatives to grow our offering and assess
product market fit. Currently we're measuring 1 key metric which serves as
heuristic for company wide success.

### Managed Node-RED instances

[Dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/90315614-39bf-4eac-ba3d-45b4c635940e/page/P1V6C)

FlowForge is the key product we're verifying in the market currently. Each
customer electing to use FlowForge to help them in their Node-RED journey is a
signal we're providing value.

An instance is either a remote Node-RED running the [FlowForge Device Agent](https://flowforge.com/docs/user/devices/),
a hosted Node-RED in the FlowForge Cluster, or an otherwise FlowForge licensed 
and supported Node-RED instance.

Telemetry collection is opt-in, and dependant on an internet connection. As such
it's anticipated to under report the true number of FlowForge managed instances.

Target growth for this metric is 10% week over week.
