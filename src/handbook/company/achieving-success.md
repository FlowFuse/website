# Achieving Success at FlowForge

There's multiple ways to align a company around business goals, and at FlowForge
we've identified two ways to help us shape this. The core metric are captured in
the [KPI](#kpi). A KPI is a tool to identify problems and areas for improvement.

The second tool employed at FlowForge to improve on the identfied problems are [OKR](#okrs)s.

## KPI

A KPI, or Key Point Indicator, is used as a heuristic metric for company wide
success. At FlowForge we're engaged in many initiatives to grow our offering and
assess product market fit. At this time there's one KPI to track progress.

### Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)

Now FlowForge has a stable and maturing product, we're trying to verify product
market fit. The market verification requires sales, and ARR is a good metric to
track this.

Incidental revenue, that's not recurring, doesn't factor into this metric as it's
hard to build a business with products with unpredictable revenue streams. Furthermore,
it's usually harder to scale.

Target growth for this metric is 10% week over week.

## OKRs

OKRs, Objectives and Key Results, are action oriented goals that have a _measureable_
impact on the company. OKRs are intended to be bold goals, where the bar is set
high enough that one still takes a leap.

Given goals are intended to be bold and aggressive, performance on the OKRs has
no influence on compensation or any other performance indicator of a department
or individual.

### Anatomy of an OKR

Per timeboxed period a couple of OKRs are created. Each of them should describe
clearly what the objective is, the key results that will be used to measure the success.
Further, the goal and plan to achieve it should align with the [values](./values/).

### The process

Before the OKR period, the CEO sets company wide OKRs. Each of the CEO, CTO,
Head of Marketing, Head of UX, and product manager are expected to read the OKRs
and work with their teams to develop at least 2 OKRs their team will implement to help achieve the company goal.

At the start of the OKR period, each team will present their OKRs during a company meeting. Bi-weekly meetings will be held where each team will present a quick update on the status of their OKR and current work being done to achieve the key result. At the end of the OKR period, a company wide retrospective will he held to share lessons learned from the OKR.

### Current OKRs

[OKRs are tracked here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12zOCFxot0rlRY-_hNwCmuv7_U1STqjzoaXh8EkIWtZI){rel="nofollow"}.
Every two weeks updates are shared in the [Bi-weekly KPI meeting](./communication/#bi-weekly-kpi-meeting).
