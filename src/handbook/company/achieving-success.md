# Achieving Success at FlowForge

There's multiple ways to align a company around business goals, and at FlowForge
we've identified two ways to help us shape this. The core metric are captured in
the [KPI](#kpi). A KPI is a tool to identify problems and areas for improvement.

The second tool employed at FlowForge to improve on the identfied problems are [OKR](#okr)s.

## KPI

A KPI, or Key Point Indicator, is used as a heuristic metric for company wide
success. At FlowForge we're engaged in many initiatives to grow our offering and
assess product market fit. At this time there's one KPI to track progress.

### Managed Node-RED instances

[Dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/90315614-39bf-4eac-ba3d-45b4c635940e/page/P1V6C)

FlowForge is the key product we're verifying in the market currently. Each
customer electing to use FlowForge to help them in their Node-RED journey is a
signal we're providing value.

An instance is either a remote Node-RED running the [FlowForge Device Agent](https://flowforge.com/docs/user/devices/),
a hosted Node-RED in the FlowForge Cluster, or an otherwise FlowForge licensed 
and supported Node-RED instance.

Telemetry collection is opt-in, and dependant on an internet connection. As such
it's anticipated to under report the true number of FlowForge managed instances.

Target growth for this metric is 10% week over week.

## OKRs

OKRs, Objectives and Key Results, are action oriented goals that have a _measureable_
impact on the company. OKRs are intended to be bold goals, where the bar is set
high enough that one still takes a leap.

Given goals are intended to be bold and aggressive, performance on the OKRs has
no influence on compensation or any other performance indicator of a department
or individual.

### Anatomy of an OKR

Per timeboxed period a couple of OKRs are created. Each of them should describe
clearly what the objective is, the plan to achieve that goal, and how success is
measured. Further, the goal and plan to achieve it should align with the
[values](./values/).

### The process

Before the OKR period, the CEO sets company wide OKRs. Each of the CEO, CTO,
Head of Marketing, Head of UX, and product manager are expected to read the OKRs
and create 2 OKRs of their own to help to achieve the company wide goal.

### Current OKRs

[OKRs are tracked here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12zOCFxot0rlRY-_hNwCmuv7_U1STqjzoaXh8EkIWtZI){rel="nofollow"}.
Every two weeks updates are shared in the [Bi-weekly KPI meeting](./communication/#bi-weekly-kpi-meeting).
