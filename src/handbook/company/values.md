## Values

FlowForge has a few core values. Values we aspire to live by in everything we do
at FlowForge. With a shared set of values, norms that are created every day will
align with what company we want to be, and how we conduct business. Our values
are as follows:

### üìà Results

1. We value results over the hours you spend working. We appreciate the effort, but value the results. Make users happy, care about the team member you helped. You schedule your day to make the most out of it for you. Don‚Äôt brag about hours worked, take pride in your achievements.
1. <a name="doitnow">Do it now</a>: Growth is exponential; Ship today, observe first results tomorrow, observe compounding effects in just 2 days.
1. Ownership: Take initiative, keep stakeholders in the loop, find and resolve bottlenecks. Collaborate with others. There‚Äôs one individual responsible for your achievements; You!
1. Disagree and commit: Discussion is healthy, but decisions do not need full consensus. Disagree with a point-of-view, make your case, but accept other solutions are valid too. Once a choice is made, commit as a team to follow it. Allow others to prove themselves. Reaching consensus for every decision does not scale.
1. Keep it short and simple: Don‚Äôt over-engineer your solution or let the scope creep beyond what makes sense for an iteration. Fast progress requires fast understanding. Boring solutions are good. Allow everyone to understand your solution. There will always be another iteration.


### üîÅ Iterative Improvement

1. Small Steps: Every mountain can be climbed with small steps. Make a change,
reassess your direction, repeat. Scope down your work item, reflect, and scope
it down again. Get the minimal amount of work down, but no less, find the [golden mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_%28philosophy%29).
1. Bias for Action: Don‚Äôt overthink, do what is the most natural in this moment. [Do it now](#doitnow).
1. Accepting Change: Be eager to accept change: Is it better than yesterday, and can we improve on it tomorrow?
1. Everything is a Draft: Today won‚Äôt be perfect, tomorrow will be better. Perfection is the death of progress.
1. Decide where good is good enough; understand where excellence is our company's
edge. Apply the [pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle).

### üë• Collaborative Community

1. Be inclusive: in a community everyone is different; allow them to be. We
value empathy, courtesy, and respect for each other.
1. [Information wants to be free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free):
Store information in public places by default: our Handbook and GitHub issues.
Allow others to understand you and your decisions.
1. Write things down: information stuck in calls or private conversations is lost.
Allow progress being made by anyone. Keep an agenda for meetings, write down decisions.
1. Think big picture: It‚Äôs not ‚Äúyour‚Äù issue/bug, the whole community can have
opinions and provide suggestions.

#### Be Trusting

To move with high velocity, trust needs to be given before one has had the
opportunity to earn it. People can only grow when they're able to take up
challenging tasks and project, and are then allowed to go their own route. When
challenged, ask for feedback and support, not for permission or approval.

### Communication

#### Use Candor

We use truth as a superpower, even when inconvenient to ourselves. We use it
with care and consideration of others. We won‚Äôt get everything right all of the
time. The only way we can improve is by being honest with ourselves and each
other. It can be difficult to achieve and it can feel awkward. When done right, 
with respect and a shared understanding, it can lead to a better outcome for
everyone.

We strongly encourage the sharing of thanks and feedback within FlowForge. This
can be done formally through our `@Feedback` Slackbot. You can read more in
[Communications](./communication#feedback-and-thanks)

#### Be Optimistic

We will treat all situations with an optimism that a positive result is
possible. We don‚Äôt let that get in the way of planning for all outcomes and
making the hard choices when they are needed.
