## Values

FlowForge has 4 core values. Values we aspire to live by in everything we do at
FlowForge. With a shared set of values, norms that are created every day will
align with what company we want to be, and how we conduct business. Our values
are as follows:

1. [📈 Radiant Results](#📈-radiant-results)
2. [🔁 Iterative Improvement](#🔁-iterative-improvement)
3. [⛑️  Constructive Candor]()
4. [👥 Collaborative Community]()

### 📈 Radiant Results

1. We value results over the hours you spend working. We appreciate the effort, but value the results. Make users happy, care about the team member you helped. You schedule your day to make the most out of it for you. Don’t brag about hours worked, take pride in your achievements.
1. <a name="doitnow">Do it now</a>: Growth is exponential; Ship today, observe first results tomorrow, observe compounding effects in just 2 days.
1. Ownership: Take initiative, keep stakeholders in the loop, find and resolve bottlenecks. Collaborate with others.There’s one individual responsible for your achievements; You!
1. Disagree and commit: Not everything goes like you envision it will. Accept other solutions are valid too. Allow others to prove themselves. Don’t search for consensus, consensus doesn’t scale; a company is not a democracy.
1. Keep it short and simple: Don’t over engineer your solution. Fast progress requires fast understanding. Boring solutions are good. Allow everyone to understand your solution.

### 🔁 Iterative Improvement

1. Small steps: Every mountain can be conquered with small steps. Make a change, reassess your direction, repeat. Scope down your work item, reflect, and scope it down again.
1. Bias for Action: Don’t overthink, do what is the most natural in this moment. [Do it now](#doitnow).
1. Be eager to accept change: Is it better than yesterday, and can we improve on it tomorrow?
1. Everything is a draft: Today won’t be perfect, tomorrow will be better. Perfection is the death of progress.
1. Decide where good is good enough; understand where excellence is our company's edge.

### ⛑️ Constructive Candor

1. Feedback aids growth: Tell others what they can improve.  
1. Share feedback directly; with candor and consideration how it will be received. Don’t be arrogant while sharing what others have to improve; it’s about them, not you.
1. Assume positive intent when receiving feedback. When you feel defensive it’s OK to respond later.
1. Be open and honest about your own mistakes, take ownership of them and their resolve.
1. Appreciate another. Say thanks often, [preferably in public](./communication/#feedback-and-thanks).

### 👥 Collaborative Community

1. Be inclusive: in a community everyone is different; allow them to be. We value empathy, courtesy, and respect for each other.
1. [Information wants to be free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free): Store information in public places by default: our Handbook and GitHub issues. Allow others to understand you and your decisions.
1. Write things down; information stuck in calls or private conversations is lost. Allow progress being made by anyone. Keep an agenda for meetings, write down decisions.
1. Think big picture: It’s not “your” issue/bug, the whole community can have opinions and provide suggestions.
