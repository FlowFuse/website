## Directly Responsible Individual

A DRI, also known as Directly Responsible Individual, is a method of assigning
clear ownership and accountability for specific tasks, projects, or initiatives
within an organization. The purpose of a DRI is to ensure that there is a single
individual who is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of a
particular undertaking.

When decisions need to be made regarding a DRI's area of responsibility, the DRI
is the person who has the final say and is empowered to make those decisions.
This allows for efficient decision-making and prevents decision paralysis or
ambiguity within FlowFuse. The DRI is expected to gather relevant input and
feedback from other stakeholders but is ultimately responsible for making the
final call. Other stakeholders might need to

(async) communication and collaboration with other team members and stakeholders
is crucial to ensure alignment and support for the DRI's initiatives.

The appointment of a DRI occurs through the CEO or CTO. They will identify the
areas of ownership and accountability within the organization and then assign
the appropriate DRI. The selection of a DRI is based on factors such as
expertise, experience, and the individual's ability to handle the specific task
or project successfully.

Note that both the CEO and CTO retain the right to veto decisions. This should very seldomly happen. 

DRI's weren't invented by FlowFuse, we stand on the shoulder of giants that
championed the term and iterated before us. Read about the prior art:
