# Google Workspace

## Overview

FlowFuse uses Google Workspace for collaboration and productivity tools. Our Google Workspace includes Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Meet, Calendar, and other applications that help us work efficiently as a team.

## **Sharing Work**

At FlowFuse, we believe that work should be [shared and accessible to all team members by default](https://flowfuse.com/handbook/company/security/data-management/). This transparency helps us:

* Collaborate more effectively  
* Reduce duplication of effort  
* Ensure institutional knowledge is preserved  
* Enable asynchronous work across time zones

Therefore, when saving your work, default to putting it in the shared Google Drive in the correct location. If storing your work with a wide audience isn't in accordance with our [data management policy](https://flowfuse.com/handbook/company/security/data-management/), keep it in your private Google Drive.

## **Proper Document Storage**

### **Shared Drive vs. Personal Drive**

When you create a new Google Doc, Sheet, or Slide, by default it is saved in "My Drive" \- your personal Google Drive space. While this is fine for personal drafts or notes, any work that may be valuable to others in the company should be moved to the appropriate shared folder.

### **How to Move Files to a Shared Folder**

When you create a new document that should be shared with the team:

1. Open the document in Google Docs/Sheets/Slides  
2. Click on the folder icon near the document name at the top of the page  
3. In the "Move item" dialog box, navigate to the appropriate shared folder.  
4. Select the destination folder and click "Move"

Alternatively:

1. Go to drive.google.com  
2. Find the file you want to move  
3. Right-click on the file and select "Move to"  
4. Navigate to the appropriate shared folder  
5. Click "Move here"

## **Access Permissions**

By storing your documents in the shared drive, you ensure they have the correct default permissions. However, there may be times when you need to adjust sharing settings.

To change permission settings:

1. Open the file  
2. Click the "Share" button in the top-right  
3. Adjust permissions as needed

For sensitive documents, please use the principle of least privilege \- only grant access to those who need it.

## **Best Practices**

* **Use descriptive file names** that clearly indicate the content and purpose  
* **Include dates in file names** for documents that are updated periodically  
* **Create and use templates** for recurring document types  
* **Comment instead of editing** when suggesting changes to others' work
