#### Become the standard way of running any Node-RED at any scale - Be DevOps for Node-RED

There's a wide range of deployment scenarios and FlowFuse aims to build a
platform to help each of them to be successful. FlowFuse will solve challenges
unsolved by Node-RED and push Low-Code beyond the capabilities of Node-RED.

Firstly, team collaboration. Allowing Flows to be developed by multiple
individuals, ensuring quality and correctness. Push the boundaries of Low-Code
to allow more people to collaborate.

Secondly, Node-RED is deployed in many different environments. FlowFuse will allow
everyone to achieve the best results whatever the execution context.

We believe these two points will make FlowFuse synonymous with Node-RED, and
make it attractive to individual users as well as Enterprises. Value offered
will increase exponentially as the platform scales to teams of developers and
larger deployment scenarios.

### Drive adoption of Node-RED in manufacturing

Node-RED itself is already being used today in many industries to connect OT and IT environments, due to the challenge of heterogeneous protocols and demands. This shift is part of a larger trend: teams of all types are realizing that breaking down silos has compounding effects on productivity. Especially in all kinds of manufacturing and industrial companies, the way of production is changing rapidly and therefore the need to further integrate IT and OT. 

We are positioned to become the Open-Source DevOps for Node-RED solution â€“ a single application for all innovation and transformation to effectively close the gaps that exist between OT and IT.
