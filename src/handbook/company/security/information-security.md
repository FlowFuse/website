## Overview

This Information Security Policy is intended to protect FlowForge’s employees,
partners and the company from illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either
knowingly or unknowingly.

FlowForge systems are to be used for business purposes in serving the interests of
the company, and of our clients and customers in the course of normal operations.

Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and support of
every FlowForge employee or contractor who deals with information and/or
information systems. It is the responsibility of every team member to read and
understand this policy, and to conduct their activities accordingly.

## Purpose 

The purpose of this policy is to communicate our information security policies
and outline the acceptable use and protection of FlowForge’s information and
assets. These rules are in place to protect customers, employees, and FlowForge.
Inappropriate use exposes FlowForge to risks including virus attacks, compromise
of network systems and services, financial and reputational risk, and legal and
compliance issues.

The FlowForge "Information Security Policy" is comprised of this policy and all
FlowForge policies referenced and/or linked within this document.

## Scope

This policy applies to the use of information, electronic and computing devices,
and network resources to conduct FlowForge business or interact with internal
networks and business systems, whether owned or leased by FlowForge, the employee,
or a third party. All employees, contractors, consultants, temporary, and other
workers at FlowForge and its subsidiaries are responsible for exercising good
judgment regarding appropriate use of information, electronic devices, and
network resources in accordance with FlowForge policies and standards, and local
laws and regulations.

This policy applies to employees, contractors, consultants, temporaries, and
other workers at FlowForge, including all personnel affiliated with third
parties. This policy applies to all FlowForge-controlled company and customer
data as well as all equipment, systems, networks and software owned or leased by
FlowForge.

## Security Incident Reporting

All users are required to report known or suspected security events or incidents,
including policy violations and observed security weaknesses. Incidents shall be
reported immediately or as soon as possible by sending an email to security@flowforge.com.

In your email please describe the incident or observation along with any relevant
details.

Any security issue related to vulnerabilities in the product should be reported
via our [disclosure policy](../../development/security.md).

## Device Policy

All end-user devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, desktops) must
comply with this policy.

1. System level and user level passwords must comply with the [Access Control Policy](./access-control.md).

2. Providing access to another individual, either deliberately or through failure
to secure a device is prohibited.

3. All end-user, personal (BYOD) or company owned devices used to access FlowForge
information systems (i.e. email) must adhere to the following rules and requirements:

  1. Devices must be secured with a password (or equivalent control such as biometric)
   protected screensaver or screen lock.

  2. Devices must not be left unattended in public.

4. Users must report any suspected misuse or theft of a mobile device immediately
   to security@flowforge.com

5. Avoid sharing credentials. Secrets must be stored safely, using features such
   as GitHub Secrets. For accounts and other sensitive data that need to be shared
   use the company-provided password manager, 1Password, and ensure an appropriate
   scope of sharing is used.

6. Confidential information must not be stored on portable media such as USB drives

7. Accessing FlowForge systems on public "shared" computers, such as hotel kiosks
   is strictly prohibited

8. Upon termination users agree to return all company owned devices and delete
   all company information and accounts from any personal devices 

## Acceptable Use Policy

FlowForge proprietary and customer information stored on electronic and computing
devices, whether owned or leased by FlowForge, the employee or a third party,
remains the sole property of FlowForge for the purposes of this policy.

Employees and contractors must ensure through legal or technical means that
proprietary information is protected in accordance with the [Data Management Policy](./data-management.md).

Google Drive should be used to store and share files within the company, ensuring
proper access controls are applied.

You have a responsibility to promptly report the theft, loss, or unauthorized
disclosure of FlowForge proprietary information or equipment. You may access,
use or share FlowForge proprietary information only to the extent it is authorized
and necessary to fulfill your assigned job duties.

Employees are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding the
reasonableness of personal use of company-provided devices.

For security and network maintenance purposes, authorized individuals within
FlowForge may monitor equipment, systems and network traffic at any time.
FlowForge reserves the right to audit networks and systems on a periodic basis
to ensure compliance with this policy.

Employees must ensure the software they use is properly licensed and used as
intended.

## Unacceptable Use

Under no circumstances is an employee of FlowForge authorized to engage in any
activity that is illegal under local, state, federal or international law while
utilizing FlowForge-owned resources or while representing FlowForge in any capacity.
