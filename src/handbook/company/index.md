## Legal details

### Mailing address

As a registering company we have to provide our address to customers and suppliers when they specifically request that information. For all day to day communications we should make it clear that by far the most practical way to contact us is via support@flowfuse.com.

```
FlowFuse Inc
548 Market Street
PO Box 7775 #29439

### Banking details

Customer invoices are generated in Stripe, and the preferred way for FlowFuse is to use SWIFT or bank wires as
the invoice suggests.

For larger customers with internal processes requiring our bank details, they can wire the money to the company's
checking account too. Wiring instructions to be shared by the rep are found in [our internal drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XfO_nsh0OcB7S4peKEjiPV5qNIj9avJ0/view?usp=sharing).
