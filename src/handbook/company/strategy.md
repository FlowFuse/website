# Strategy

## Our North Star

### Core believe

By empowering a larger workforce to participate in automation an acceleration of digital transformation can be realized in manufacturing, agriculture, and other productive industries. This will lead to an increase in productivity.

FlowFuse is riding two waves:
1. Companies need to accellerate their innovation. 
2. Digitalization is at the inflection point of implementation.

FlowFuse allows businesses to acquire, enrich, visualize, and build applications
through a workforce already employed.

Our current (prospective) customers have already adopted Node-RED and need to
professionalize their data streams and workflows. FlowFuse is the only company
that can help them.

### Our mission

FlowFuse exists to empower bottom-up innovation. We allow companies to professionalize their workflows to business critical applications.

### Core Values

Please see our [company values](/handbook/company/values/)

## The market

Corporations that have many data sources with unpredictable structure.

The ideal lead has adopted Node-RED already and is in the following industries:
1. Manufacturing (IIoT & Industry 4.0)
1. Logistics
1. Agriculture
1. Building management
1. Mining, Oil & Gas, and renewable energy

Due the to breath of the Node-RED community and the industries they apply it in,
FlowFuse does not qualify customers based on industry.

## Execution on our believe and mission

> We will only be successful if the Node-RED community is successful.

### Drive the growth and success of the Node-RED project

Node-RED is at the core of what we do. It's the cornerstone for the company. Our
success is fed by the success of the Node-RED ecosystem. Node-RED enables tens of
thousands to create and maintain workflows and logic of both physical devices
and digital services. Ensure their effectiveness grows, while new users are
introduced to Node-RED is vital to the success of FlowFuse.

FlowFuse will drive the Node-RED project through:

 - **Deliver features** to the core of Node-RED that are stable and provide value to the community
 - **Actively participate** in the community to establish a positive reputation and level of engagement
 - **Be model citizens** for the open governance of the project. Our activities that impact the core are discussed and developed in the open.
 - **Establish close relationships** with other stakeholders of the project - those who have their own commercial interest in the success of the project. Encourage participation and engagement in the core project.
 - **Driving adoption** of Node-RED through our advocacy and our actions.

## Become the standard way of running any Node-RED at any scale

There's a wide range of deployment scenarios for applications built on Node-RED
and FlowFuse aims to build a platform to help each of them to be successful.
FlowFuse will solve challenges unsolved by Node-RED and push Low-Code and the
extensions of Node-RED beyond the current capabilities.

FlowFuse streamlines Node-RED for commercial use. On many levels FlowFuse helps
organisations streamline their deployments with multi-tenancy,
Role-based access control, audit logging, and enhanced security controls.

Teams are more effective with FlowFuse through our collaboration tooling.
Allowing Flows to be developed by multiple individuals, ensuring quality and
correctness. Push the boundaries of Low-Code to allow more people to collaborate.

Furthermore, Node-RED is deployed in many different envirnments. FlowFuse
empowers everyone to achieve the best results whatever the execution context.

We believe these two points will make FlowFuse synonymous with Node-RED, and
make it attractive to individual users as well as Enterprises. Value offered
will increase exponentially as the platform scales to teams of developers and
larger deployment scenarios.

## Drive adoption of Node-RED in manufacturing

Node-RED itself is already being used today in many industries to connect OT and IT environments, due to the challenge of heterogeneous protocols and demands. This shift is part of a larger trend: teams of all types are realizing that breaking down silos has compounding effects on productivity. Especially in all kinds of manufacturing and industrial companies, the way of production is changing rapidly and therefore the need to further integrate IT and OT. 

We are positioned to become the Open-Source DevOps for Node-RED solution â€“ a single application for all innovation and transformation to effectively close the gaps that exist between OT and IT.

## Build an inclusive, high-performance team

As a new company that starts small but aspires to grow, we need to ensure that growth is well managed, sustainable and rewarding.

Our [values](./values) help shape the culture we want to build, both inside the company and beyond.
