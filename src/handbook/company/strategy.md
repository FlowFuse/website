## FlowFuse in one sentence
FlowFuse helps teams easily build, deploy, and manage automation workflows — with the simplicity of low-code and the power of modern DevOps.

## FlowFuse's Definition
Built on the simplicity of Node-RED, FlowFuse adds the tools teams need to scale automation workflows with confidence.
FlowFuse is a platform that helps organizations build and manage powerful low-code data applications using Node-RED.
We make it easy to connect systems, automate processes, and build industrial or digital solutions — all while giving IT teams the control, security, and scalability they need.
Whether you’re an engineer, a developer, or a company scaling up operations, FlowFuse bridges the gap between innovation and reliability.

## FlowFuse in-depth
FlowFuse is a software platform that helps companies manage and scale applications built with Node-RED, a popular visual programming tool used to automate tasks and connect systems. While Node-RED allows users to quickly create powerful applications by wiring together different building blocks, it becomes difficult to manage once used across many devices, teams, or environments. That’s where FlowFuse comes in.

FlowFuse adds the structure, tools, and safety needed to use Node-RED in professional and industrial settings. It allows companies to organize and control multiple Node-RED instances, whether they’re running on the cloud or on physical machines like factory equipment. With FlowFuse, users can develop applications, test them safely, and deploy them to different environments without fear of breaking things. Teams can work together more effectively thanks to user access controls, audit logs, and centralized monitoring. It supports both SaaS and self-hosted models, so companies can keep full control when needed, especially in industries with strict security or privacy requirements.

Ultimately, FlowFuse transforms the speed and flexibility of Node-RED into something reliable, scalable, and secure — making it suitable not just for individual developers or hobbyists, but for entire organizations running critical systems. It gives companies the confidence to innovate quickly while staying in control.

## FlowFuse's Mission

FlowFuse will empower 1 billion people to fuse the digital realm and physical
reality through building bespoke workflows, applications, and integrations,
unleashing their creativity so that they can effortlessly leverage their own
skills and expertise.

## Achieving our Mission

At the core of FlowFuse is Node-RED, the Low-Code platform that allows many
to build software with little or no coding knowledge. This enables anyone to be innovative and develop solutions to be successful in their respective roles. FlowFuse will only be successful if
Node-RED becomes the default way to write software for hundreds of thousands of people.
FlowFuse is, and will remain, the primary contributor to Node-RED. Our product is
the best way to run Node-RED at any scale.

Furthermore, FlowFuse aims to make it a great experience to build, deploy, and
maintain software -- especially for non-software engineers. Allowing complex things
to be achieved. Two good examples are
1. FlowFuse Dashboard - Allowing to build Dashboards and interactive applications
1. Project-Link - Linking Edge devices to the Cloud, enabling broadcasts and point-to-point connections

A key differentiator for FlowFuse is our approach to licensing of our software.
The core is open, free as in beer and as in speech. Our product is open for scrutiny,
usage, improvements, for the world. While there's a subset of the product
proprietary licensed, the source is available to read. We believe that Open Source
Software plays a key part in education, reducing vendor lock-in, and community building.

## The market

We focus on [Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)](https://flowfuse.com/handbook/customer/marketing/messaging/) companies, which are those in manufacturing, logistics, and other data-intensive industrial sectors where operational efficiency is critical to providing value.

Within those companies, we focus our outreach and marketing activities on people who are responsible for improving engineering processes. These individuals are often Architects, Engineering Managers, and specialists in IT or OT. 

## The problems 

1. Data is in Silos and Inaccessible: Industrial data is often hard to access and extract, fragmented, and trapped within disparate systems, making it difficult to access and consolidate for analysis. Engineers need a way to break down these silos and unify their data sources.
1. Lack of Visualization and Feedback Loops: Existing industrial data systems often fail to provide intuitive visualizations and real-time feedback mechanisms. Engineers need a platform that allows them to easily visualize data, monitor performance, and quickly identify areas for improvement.
1. Barriers to Building Solutions: Many industrial engineers lack the correct tools and resources to build custom applications for their specific needs. IT departments typically are focused on business operations and don’t have expertise on industrial systems or processes. However, data analysis applications for industrial processes also need to meet company security and compliance requirements. The industrial side of the organization requires a solution that empowers them to create solutions, within compliance guidelines, without relying heavily on IT departments or external developers.
1. Overwhelming Complexity of Industrial Systems: Industrial environments are characterized by a vast array of protocols, technologies, and legacy systems. This complexity makes it difficult for teams to integrate and leverage data from different sources into a view of operations that can help identify optimizations.

## Why these problems are significant

1. Suboptimal Decision-Making: When engineers lack access to comprehensive and timely data, they are forced to make decisions based on incomplete or inaccurate information. This can lead to missed opportunities, inefficient processes, and costly errors.
1. Slow Response to Issues: Without real-time feedback loops and interactive visualizations, it can be difficult to detect and respond to emerging problems promptly. This can result in production delays, quality issues, and increased downtime.
1. Missed Opportunities for Innovation: The inability to easily build custom solutions stifles innovation. Engineers may have brilliant ideas for improvements but lack the means to implement them, leaving valuable potential untapped.

## The Value

The FlowFuse Platform addresses the problems status above by providing our ICP with the tools they need to:

1. Unify and Access Data: FlowFuse breaks down data silos, aggregate data from disparate sources, and make it easily accessible for analysis and decision making in a secure way. 
1. Visualize and Interact: FlowFuse offers intuitive visualizations, real-time feedback loops, and interactive dashboards that enable engineers to monitor performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.
1. Build Custom Solutions: The low-code platform empowers engineers to create custom applications, dashboards, and automation workflows without extensive coding knowledge.
1. Simplify Complexity: We abstract away the complexities of industrial systems, providing a comprehensive user-friendly interface that allows engineers to focus on solving problems, not wrestling with technology.

FlowFuse uses Open-Source technologies like Node-RED and MQTT to help our customers being successful in remedying their problems.
