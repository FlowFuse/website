## Our North Star

### Our mission

We believe that domain experts are the primary drivers of innovation. By empowering these experts with the right tools, we enable them to excel not only in their current roles but throughout their careers. FlowFuse is dedicated to providing solutions that unlock their potential, ensuring that their expertise translates directly into impactful, innovative outcomes.

### Our Vision

Our vision is that everyone will become programmers, whether through low-code platforms like FlowFuse, or traditional programming languages. We foresee a future where programming skills are ubiquitous, empowering individuals across all domains to innovate and create solutions efficiently.

### Core Values

Please see our [company values](/handbook/company/values/)

## The market

Corporations that have many data sources with unpredictable structure.

The ideal lead has adopted Node-RED already and is in the following industries:
1. Manufacturing (IIoT & Industry 4.0)
1. Logistics
1. Agriculture
1. Building management
1. Mining, Oil & Gas, and renewable energy

Due to the breadth of the Node-RED community and the industries they
apply it in, FlowFuse does not qualify customers based on industry.


## Execution on our belief and mission

> We will only be successful if the Node-RED community is successful.

### Drive the growth and success of the Node-RED project

Node-RED is at the core of what we do. It's the cornerstone for the company. Our
success is fed by the success of the Node-RED ecosystem. Node-RED enables tens of
thousands to create and maintain workflows and logic of both physical devices
and digital services. Ensure their effectiveness grows, while new users are
introduced to Node-RED is vital to the success of FlowFuse.

FlowFuse will drive the Node-RED project through:

 - **Deliver features** to the core of Node-RED that are stable and provide value to the community
 - **Actively participate** in the community to establish a positive reputation and level of engagement
 - **Be model citizens** for the open governance of the project. Our activities that impact the core are discussed and developed in the open.
 - **Establish close relationships** with other stakeholders of the project - those who have their own commercial interest in the success of the project. Encourage participation and engagement in the core project.
 - **Driving adoption** of Node-RED through our advocacy and our actions.

### Become the standard way of running any Node-RED for professional usage

There's a wide range of deployment scenarios for applications built on Node-RED
and FlowFuse aims to build a platform to help all businesses to be successful.
FlowFuse will solve challenges unsolved by Node-RED and push Low-Code and the
extensions of Node-RED beyond the current capabilities.

FlowFuse streamlines Node-RED for commercial use. On many levels FlowFuse helps
organisations. By alleviating them of their operation burden and help scaling their 
Node-RED fleets, providing improved developer velocity, and ensure deployments
are secure and abide by the compliance of the customer.

We believe this will make FlowFuse synonymous with Node-RED, and make it attractive to
SMB users as well as enterprises.

### Drive adoption of Node-RED in traditional industries

Traditional industrial businesses (producing atoms, not bits) are currently digitalizing
their operations to optimize their margins. They are struggling to acquire data produced by
their operations, enrich and combine data from sources, and lastly visualizing and interacting
with that data. Their production facilities are a mix of legacy machinery and modern digital-ready machinery.

Companies adopting Node-RED and FlowFuse are unlikely to need to restaff or upskill their staffing
to accelerate their digitalization efforts. The mass adoption of Node-RED by industrial companies
creates an opportunity for FlowFuse to offer a platform which professionalizes the operation of their Node-RED applications.

### Build an inclusive, high-performance team

As a new company that starts small but aspires to grow, we need to ensure that growth is well managed, sustainable and rewarding.

Our [values](./values) help shape the culture we want to build, both inside the company and beyond.
