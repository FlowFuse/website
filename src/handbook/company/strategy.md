# Strategy

> We will only be successful if the whole Node-RED community is successful.

Our company vision has four parts and captures what we want FlowFuse to evolve
into in the next 5 years. The vision is inspiration for the [product strategy](../product/strategy.md), which is updated continuously. It’s based on the four pillars. This allows us to adapt to changing market conditions so that we meet customer needs.

- Drive the growth and success of the [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) project
- Build a platform that becomes the standard way of running Node-RED at any scale - Be DevOps for Node-RED
- Drive adoption of Node-RED in manufacturing
- Build an inclusive, high-performance team

## Drive the growth and success of the Node-RED project

Node-RED is at the core of what we do. It is the reason the company exists. Our
success is fed by the success of the core project. Node-RED enables tens of
thousands to create and maintain workflows and logic of both physical devices
and digital services. Ensure their effectiveness grows, while new users are
introduced to Node-RED is vital to the success of FlowFuse.

FlowFuse will drive the Node-RED project through:

 - **Deliver features** to the core of Node-RED that are stable and provide value to the community
 - **Actively participate** in the community to establish a positive reputation and level of engagement
 - **Be model citizens** for the open governance of the project. Our activities that impact the core are discussed and developed in the open.
 - **Establish close relationships** with other stakeholders of the project - those who have their own commercial interest in the success of the project. Encourage participation and engagement in the core project.
 - **Driving adoption** of Node-RED through our advocacy and our actions.

## Become the standard way of running any Node-RED at any scale

There's a wide range of deployment scenarios for applications built on Node-RED
and FlowFuse aims to build a platform to help each of them to be successful.
FlowFuse will solve challenges unsolved by Node-RED and push Low-Code and the
extensions of Node-RED beyond the current capabilities.

FlowFuse streamlines Node-RED for commercial use. On many levels FlowFuse helps
organisations streamline their deployments with multi-tenancy,
Role-based access control, audit logging, and enhanced security controls.

Teams are more effective with FlowFuse through our collaboration tooling.
Allowing Flows to be developed by multiple individuals, ensuring quality and
correctness. Push the boundaries of Low-Code to allow more people to collaborate.

Furthermore, Node-RED is deployed in many different envirnments. FlowFuse
empowers everyone to achieve the best results whatever the execution context.

We believe these two points will make FlowFuse synonymous with Node-RED, and
make it attractive to individual users as well as Enterprises. Value offered
will increase exponentially as the platform scales to teams of developers and
larger deployment scenarios.

## Drive adoption of Node-RED in manufacturing

Node-RED itself is already being used today in many industries to connect OT and IT environments, due to the challenge of heterogeneous protocols and demands. This shift is part of a larger trend: teams of all types are realizing that breaking down silos has compounding effects on productivity. Especially in all kinds of manufacturing and industrial companies, the way of production is changing rapidly and therefore the need to further integrate IT and OT. 

We are positioned to become the Open-Source DevOps for Node-RED solution – a single application for all innovation and transformation to effectively close the gaps that exist between OT and IT.

## Build an inclusive, high-performance team

As a new company that starts small but aspires to grow, we need to ensure that growth is well managed, sustainable and rewarding.

Our [values](./values) help shape the culture we want to build, both inside the company and beyond.

## Strategic Initiatives

### 2022

There are four pillars of the product we're investing in:
1. Provide the best Node-RED experience.
1. Enable users to run Node-RED at the edge.
1. Enable teams to collaborate when working with Node-RED.
1. Meet the compliance needs of the enterprise.

The [product plan](../product/plan.md) goes into this in more depth.
Check out our [roadmap](/product/roadmap/) for on what we're pursuing in the next few releases.

Furthermore, we will continue our involvement with the Node-RED community.

1. **Provide technical leadership and direction** - This includes
    - Flow Testing Framework
    - Runtime Hooks on Deploy path

2. **Improve the node ecosystem**. This includes:
    - **node-red-dev** - CLI tool for node developers to help them produce higher quality nodes
    - Integrating **node-red-dev** into the Flow Library to provide node scorecards

3. **Improve the Getting Started experience** - update and expand the getting started docs to provide a more consistent and broader range of options/platforms to run on.

4. **Community events**
    - Establish a regular Node-RED virtual meetup for community members to share what they are doing with Node-RED.
    - Work towards a global Node-RED Con 2022 event in conjunction with the Node-RED Japan User Group. Build on the success of the 2021 event's global track, to make it bigger, with more EU/US-centric content and timezone accessibility

## Key metrics

At FlowFuse we're engaged in many initiatives to grow our offering and assess
product market fit. Currently we're measuring 2 key metrics which serve as
heuristic for company wide success.

### Installed Platforms

FlowFuse is the key product we're verifying in the market currently. Each
platform installed and running shows value is delivered to customers. Through
telemetry we know the number of instances that reported their unique instance ID.

Other than the number of unique instances reporting on telemetry the last 7 days
we measure the number of managed instances of Node-RED through FlowFuse. This
is the sum of projects and devices.

Telemetry collection is opt-in, and dependant on an internet connection. As such
it's anticipated to under report the true number of FlowFuse managed instances.

Target growth for this metric is 10% week over week.
