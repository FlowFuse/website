# FlowFuse Handbook

This handbook contains all the information about how FlowFuse is run. It's a
living set of documents - collectively we'll [iterate](/handbook/company/values/#%F0%9F%94%81-iterative-improvement)
on it as we learn and discover new things.

### About the Handbook

The FlowFuse handbook is inspired by the [GitLab handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/about/).
As an all-remote company, we share [their rationale](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/about/#advantages) for having a handbook.

The aim is to avoid institutional knowledge building up inside our heads without
also being written down for others to share. We could do that all on the internal
Google Drive, but by publishing in the handbook it allows for an open and honest
conversation about what we do.

Our handbook is more than just a collection of policies; it is the living embodiment of our core values. We believe that documenting our work and culture is essential to our success, and this handbook is how we put our values into practice every single day.
It's how we ensure that information wants to be free, and that our collaborative community can thrive.

## Why the Handbook Matters
It's All About Our Values.
* Results & Iterative Improvement: Our handbook is the ultimate tool for achieving results and making fast progress. When we write things down in the handbook first, we create a single, universally accessible source of truth for solutions and processes. This prevents the "torturous loop of interruptions, meetings, and suboptimal knowledge transfers" that happens when people have to constantly re-ask for information.  By making the handbook a living document that is never finished, we embrace the idea that "everything is a draft" and can be improved with small, iterative steps.
* Collaborative Community: The handbook is the central hub for our community. We default to storing information in the handbook and on GitHub issues because information wants to be free. This asynchronous way of working ensures that discussions and decisions are not lost in private chats or forgotten after a meeting. This allows anyone to get the full context of a project and contribute, empowering our team members and fostering a shared sense of ownership. 
* Constructive Candor & Customer Empathy: A public handbook is a powerful way to demonstrate constructive candor and customer empathy. By making our processes and culture transparent, we show our commitment to improving. A public handbook is open to suggestions from both our internal team and the wider community, allowing us to incorporate new perspectives and improve on our own ideas. This also helps us attract people who are already aligned with our values, as they can see our culture and mission firsthand.

## Internal information
Whilst instinctively we want to be open in all we do, there will inevitably be 
content that is [not appropriate to make public][data-class]. That content is not
shared in this handbook.

## Handbook-first

Being handbook-first means that our handbook is not a static document we update after a decision is made. It is the very place where our proposals and discussions happen. We believe that this approach is the most effective way to live our values and ensure that our communication is clear, efficient, and transparent.

Instead of starting a discussion on Slack or in a meeting, we start it in the handbook. Here’s how we do it:

* Start with a Proposal, not a Chat: When you have an idea for a new process, a change to an existing one, or a solution to a problem, you don't send a message on Slack. You create a proposal directly in the handbook. This proposal is a merge request that includes your suggested changes, allowing everyone to see and comment on the content directly. This ensures the full context of a discussion is preserved and universally accessible.
* Integrate Discussion and Documentation: The discussion about your proposal happens right there in the merge request. Team members can provide feedback, ask questions, and suggest edits. This allows us to disagree and commit in a transparent way. Once a consensus is reached or a decision is made, the final version is merged into the handbook, and the entire discussion trail is saved for future reference.
* Empower Everyone to Contribute: This system allows anyone at Flowfuse—from a new hire to a senior leader—to contribute directly to our company's culture and processes. It generates a shared responsibility to maintain the pace of documentation through a pay-it-forward mentality. The history of every change is visible, showing how learning happens and how iteration shapes proposals.
* Eliminate Wasted Effort: By making the handbook the hub of our collaborative work, we ensure that the information we need is always where it should be. This prevents us from having to document something after the fact—a step that is often skipped—and avoids the "torturous pattern of people pinging people for updates". This is how we prioritize results and stay focused on what matters.
