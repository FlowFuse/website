# FlowFuse Handbook

This handbook contains all the information about how FlowFuse is run. It's a
living set of documents - collectively we'll [iterate](/handbook/company/values/#%F0%9F%94%81-iterative-improvement)
on it as we learn and discover new things.

Whilst instinctively we want to be open in all we do, there will inevitably be 
content that is [not appropriate to make public][data-class]. That content is not
shared in this handbook.

[data-class]: /handbook/company/security/data-management/#data-classification

The handbook is here for the whole company to help maintain. Pull-requests are welcome and [strongly encouraged](#contributing).

### About the Handbook

The FlowFuse handbook is inspired by the [GitLab handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/about/).
As an all-remote company, we share [their rationale](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/about/#advantages) for having a handbook.

The aim is to avoid institutional knowledge building up inside our heads without
also being written down for others to share. We could do that all on the internal
Google Drive, but by publishing in the handbook it allows for an open and honest
conversation about what we do.
