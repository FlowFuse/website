# Use Cases

![Use Cases](./images/use-cases.png){data-zoomable width="1000px"}
_Diagram to show a breakdown of the who, what and where of the three core Node-RED use cases we see._

This page is dedicated to describing the use cases that we see our customers using FlowFuse and Node-RED for.

It's purpose is to provide a centralized resource that unifies product, marketing and sales in ensuring
everyone understands _why_ people come to FlowFuse, _what_ they are building with Node-RED on
FlowFuse, _where_ those Instances run, and consequently _how_ FlowFuse can help them.

It also covers the [ISA-95 levels](https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/isa-95-standard),
which is a standard for industrial automation, where these use cases fit into.

If you want to find out more about _who_ is using FlowFuse and Node-RED, please refer to our
[Personas](./personas/index.md) and [Ideal Customer Profile](../marketing/messaging#ideal-customer-profile-(icp)) pages.

The three use cases we see are for building flows with FlowFuse and Node-RED are:

1. [Application Development](#application-development) - Ranging from a simple Dashboard to display data in a database, to complex ecosystems that integrate multiple services to create full, enterprise grade applications.
2. [Event-Driven Workflows/Automation](#event-driven-workflowsautomation) - Flows that have some triggers/inputs, logic to compute on the data, and outputs that take action.
3. [Data Extraction](#data-extraction) - Interacting with hardware to extract data and publish it to a UNS or other source. This is a core IIoT use-case.

It's important to understand which use cases prospects care about, as this will help us align our messaging and product demonstrations to their needs.
Each of these use cases provide different value to different customers, and consequently this can see Node-RED (and consequently FlowFuse)
competing against different companies and solutions.

## Application Development

![Application Development](./images/use-cases-app-building.png){data-zoomable width="600px"}
_Application Development use cases can use any combination of these five core ingredients._

Application Development use cases are those where Node-RED is used in conjunction with other
services, for example a Database, Realtime MQTT Broker, AI Agents and Dashboard.

### Where

- ‚úÖ Hosted Instances
- ‚úÖ Remote Instances

Applications built with FlowFuse are most often deployed as Hosted Instances, running in a
centralized infrastructure, often collating data sources and visualizing in Dashboards. However,
they're certainly not limited to Hosted Instances, as we have many customers running full user
interfaces/dashboards at the edge on factory floors that may be displaying local data sources.

### Who/What

- ‚úÖ ICP Customers
- ‚úÖ Non-ICP Customers

We have customers that cover both ICP and non-ICP use cases.

#### ICP Use Cases

- ‚úÖ ISA Level 4
- ‚úÖ ISA Level 3
- ‚úÖ ISA Level 2
- ‚ùå ISA Level 1
- ‚ùå ISA Level 0

Applications built by ICP customers are those generally found at ISA levels 2-4. These customers
are typically building user interfaces for Dashboards or admin systems for manufacturing plants, curating
data from multiple sources, e.g. a UNS or MES, or acting as an interface for a SCADA system.

With our MQTT offering (FlowFuse Broker) and database offering (FlowFuse Tables) are
popular to support the Node-RED flows that define the core logic of these applications.

AI is seen here whereby a chat interface can be built and provide natural language interfaces to
a UNS or MES. Applications can also display data generated by predictive AI models that monitor
data feeds and forecast ahead of time their expected behavior.

#### Non-ICP Use Cases

Non-ICP use cases here are _vast_, if you name it, you can build it. Any integration with
digital services (e.g. databases, realtime data feeds or AI Agents) that may require a
custom user interface or Dashboard fall into this bracket.

Internally we use FlowFuse ourselves as a non-ICP user to create customer success Dashboards
that track our customer's use of FlowFuse, integrate with HubSpot to track prospects and conversations,
as well as creating applications that collate data from GitHub to improve our own internal
engineering project management.

### Scale

- üüß Volume: Low-Medium (1-100's of Instances)
- üü© Value: Very High

Given that applications are built as a centralized component that integrate multiple services and
data sources together, the number of Instances running this applications is lower, however, the
value to a customer for each of these single instances is very high.

## Event-Driven Workflows/Automation

![Event-Driven Workflows/Automation](./images/use-cases-workflows.png){data-zoomable width="600px"}
_Event-Driven Workflows/Automation use cases involve a trigger/input, computation and resulting actions._

Event-Driven Workflows/Automation use cases are those where Node-RED is used to build a
event-driven workflow or automation.

### Where

- ‚úÖ Hosted Instances
- ‚úÖ Remote Instances

Event-Driven Workflows/Automation can be equally run as Hosted Instances or Remote Instances.

Hosted Instances are typically workflows that are integrating _digital_ services, triggered
by a given event, processing data from multiple sources and then taking some action. We are
also seeing a growing user base here for having AI Agents conduct decision making and taking appropriate
actions using MCP Servers (which can be built on FlowFuse).

For Remote Instances, generally these workflows are driven directly by data from hardware,
for example triggering alerts in a production line if a value exceeds a threshold, or automatically
opening a work item ticket in a help-desk system if a machine fault is detected.

### Who/What

- ‚úÖ ICP Customers
- ‚úÖ Non-ICP Customers

We have customers that cover both ICP and non-ICP use cases.

#### ICP Use Cases

- ‚úÖ ISA Level 4
- ‚úÖ ISA Level 3
- ‚úÖ ISA Level 2
- ‚úÖ ISA Level 1
- ‚ùå ISA Level 0

Automations and workflows can cover a vast collection of use cases, from simple workflows that
trigger alarms based on thresholds of multiple conditions, automatically creating PDF reports
that are e-mailed to production line management when particular events take place, to complex
use cases where AI Agents are deployed as decision makers based on integrations with multiple
digital services.

The true value of FlowFuse and Node-RED here comes from the ability to easily connect the physical
world to the digital realm, and vice-versa. Automations can be built to control machinery based
on data fed from digital services, and likewise, data can be fed from hardware to digital
services to be processed and acted upon.

Some example use cases we've seen here are:

- Condition-based monitoring that uses AI and analytics to alert (using e-mail, Telegram
or other systems) of imminent machine failures, with an auto-scheduling or maintenance activity.
- Packaging staff scanning items off shelf/out of warehouse where the inventory count is
queried and if found to be below threshold, automatically ordering more inventory.
- Integrations with Production Lines and a PA system where a Production line signals the
facility has stopped and alerts shop floor staff via a overhead display and the PA alerts using text-to-speech.

#### Non-ICP Use Cases

From marketing integrations that automatically generate leads, social posts and follow up emails,
to integrations that can alerts users in Slack, Discord or Microsoft Teams when
certain events take place, these are all examples of non-ICP use cases.

The freedom and scope of what can be built with FlowFuse and Node-RED is vast, you can
take any collection of digital services and hardware data feeds and easily build a workflow to
integrate them together, taking any appropriate action as a consequence.

### Scale

- üüß Volume: Medium (10-100's of Instances)
- üü© Value: High

It's common to see more Instances running automations than we do in the Application Development
use cases, mostly because the amount of logic within a single Instance is generally simpler.
The value provided by a single workflow is still high, and may be saving users hours of time
on each workflow run, that would have otherwise required manual intervention or effort.

## Data Extraction

![Data Extraction](./images/use-cases-extraction.png){data-zoomable width="600px"}
_Data Extraction use cases involve pulling data from hardware, often running at the Edge._

The most common Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) use-case, this use case encapsulates Node-RED
running on hardware, interfacing directly with sensors or via a PLC, reading data and publishing
it to a UNS or other source.
