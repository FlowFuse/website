# Glossary

FlowFuse empowers everyone to build custom applications to achieve their business goals.
This glossary defines common terms you'll encounter when building solutions that integrate with industrial systems and processes.

## ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)

Business management software that integrates core processes such as finance, HR, supply chain, and manufacturing.
ERP often connects with MES to provide an end-to-end view of operations.

## MES (Manufacturing Execution System)

A system that monitors, tracks, documents, and controls the process of manufacturing goods on the factory floor.
It bridges the gap between enterprise-level planning (ERP) and machine-level control (SCADA/PLC).

## OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)

A key performance indicator that measures the efficiency and effectiveness of manufacturing equipment.
OEE is the product of Availability * Performance * Quality
While 100% is the ideal, 85% is the generally accepted "world-class" benchmark for manufacturers

### The Three Components of OEE:

 * Availability: Measures downtime losses. This is the percentage of time the equipment is actually running when it is scheduled to be. It accounts for all planned and unplanned stops, like equipment breakdowns or changeovers.
 * Performance: Measures speed losses. This is the percentage of parts produced compared to the ideal maximum speed. It accounts for minor stops and slow cycles that reduce the equipment's output.
 * Quality: Measures quality losses. This is the percentage of good parts produced out of the total parts produced. It accounts for any defective or rejected parts.

## SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)

A software system used to monitor and control industrial processes.
SCADA provides real-time data, alarms, and reporting for infrastructure such as factories, utilities, and energy systems.
SCADA, where present, is often used for automated data collection of facilities used in the measurement of OEE.

## Andon

A visual and/or audible alert system used in manufacturing to highlight issues, signal assistance requests, or stop production when problems occur.
It improves communication and problem resolution on the shop floor.
If run/stop data generated by an Andon can be captured, it can form part of a reporting system nad OEE calculations.

## PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)

An industrial computer designed to operate in harsh environments.
PLCs are used to automate machinery and processes by executing programmed logic.
In cases where automated downtime recording is required, the PLC might incorporate specific logic for indicating the state of the machine.

## MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)

A lightweight messaging protocol often used for IoT and industrial applications to transfer data from sensors and machines.
MQTT is becoming more common and can be found in PLCs meaning data collection can be greatly simplified.

## TPM (Total Productive Maintenance)

A maintenance strategy focused on improving equipment reliability by involving operators in routine maintenance, reducing downtime, and preventing failures.

## Lean Manufacturing

A production methodology that aims to reduce waste, improve efficiency, and deliver more value to customers with fewer resources.
Foundational tools of Lean Manufacturing include:

* 5S: The 5s methodology uses five terms (Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain) to create a clean, organized, and efficient work environment, which is a critical first step in eliminating waste.
* Kaizen: The philosophy of continuous improvement. This approach encourages all employees to make small, incremental changes to processes over time to improve efficiency and quality. It's a key part of lean culture.
* Kanban: A visual scheduling system used to manage and limit work in progress (WIP). It signals when to start new work based on demand, helping to achieve a "just-in-time" flow and prevent overproduction.

## Six Sigma

A set of techniques and tools for process improvement, focused on reducing variability and defects in manufacturing.

### Core Principles

1. Customer satisfaction: All efforts are focused on meeting customer requirements and improving their experience.
2. Process focus: Emphasizes the point that if you fix the process, the output will consistently improve.
3. Remove variation form the process: Less variation leads to more predictable and reliable results.
4. Empower people in the process: Six Sigma relies on trained and empowered teams to drive change and maintain improvements.
5. Data driven decisions: Decisions should be based on facts and analysis. You biggest problem might be chronic losses not major breakdowns. Data and analysis will reveal this.
6. Continuous improvement: Ongoing, incremental improvements can accumulate to drive significant long-term results and avoid a return to less efficient processes.

### Methodologies

#### DMAIC

The DMAIC approach is typically used in problem solving when improving existing processes. The five steps are defined as:

* Define: Identify the problem, goal and requirement.
* Measure: Collect data to evaluate improvements.
* Analyze: Use the data for understanding the problem.
* Improve: Apply improvements to remove the problem.
* Control: Control the process so improvements are not lost.


#### DMADV 

The DMADV approach is typically used when creating a new product or new/overhauled process. The five steps are defined as:

* Define: Identify the problem, goal and requirement.
* Measure: Collect data to evaluate improvements.
* Analyze: Use the data for understanding the problem.
* Design: Generate designed for the new product or process.
* Verify: Control the process so improvements are not lost.


## Digital Twin

A virtual representation of a physical asset, process, or system that is used for simulation, monitoring, and optimization.
