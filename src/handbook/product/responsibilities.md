## What is the Product Manager not responsible for?

- Technical decisions on how the product is built or architected. 
- A team of engineers: The PM will take the lead in decisions about the product, but not manage the people implementing it.
- Shipping in time
- Effort estimations, the Product Manager provides effort estimation when creating issues, as outlined in the [handbook](../development/releases/planning.md#effort-estimation). However, the DRI for this process is the CTO.
