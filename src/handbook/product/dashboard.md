# Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 - Project

The Node-RED Dashboard, a vital tool for creating live dashboards and user interfaces for Node-RED flows, is to be succeeded due to its reliance on the no-longer-maintained Angular v1. This outdated foundation presents potential security issues that cannot be addressed with mere patches. To counter this, FlowForge has undertaken the development of a new, modern, interactive data visualization and dashboard tool. This new project, set to replace the existing Node-RED Dashboard, will be published as a separate package. It will maintain the core principles of open-source, community-driven development under the Apache 2.0 license, and is designed to safely usher the Node-RED community into the future of data visualization.

## Release Cadence
We follow Agile methodology, releasing features as soon as they're fully developed and tested. This means the frequency of our releases will pick up. Every two weeks, we plan to publish a blog post titled "What's New in Node-RED Dashboard". These posts will announce and discuss the newly released features and updates. The 1.0 release is scheduled to take place within the time frame ending in late September 2023 and signifies a feature equivalence with the previous Dashboard.

Upon the release of 1.0, the 0.x line will be declared outdated. In general, no fixes will be backported to the 0.x line, though critical security updates might be considered individually.

## Monetization

We plan to adopt the open-core strategy, meaning all features from the former dashboard, along with other enhancements, will be available as described under the Apache 2.0 license. Additionally, an enterprise extension of the dashboard will be offered, with features tailored to suit specific enterprise [personas](./personas/). This arrangement acknowledges that individuals with higher positions within an organization often have unique needs and demands.
