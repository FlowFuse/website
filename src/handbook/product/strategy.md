# Product Strategy

Our strategy is an indication and statement of intent for the next 2 years, and reflects FlowFuse’s vision, to become the leading "Low-Code IIoT Application Platform".
FlowFuse will allow everyone to build custom applications to achieve their business goals and depend less on off-the-shelf software.

It’s a draft, as everything in the handbook is a draft, so we will revisit regularly and iterate when there is a reason to do so. FlowFuse is a 100 percent agile company, so our product is; timing is everything.
Have a look at our [roadmap](/product/roadmap/) for what we're pursuing in the upcoming releases.

## Market Vision

**Become the leading "Low-Code IIoT Application Platform"**

An IIoT platform is a comprehensive solution that securely collects, integrates, and manages vast volumes of data from IoT endpoints. It supports various manufacturer and industry protocols, normalizing and analyzing data at the edge and in the cloud. By bridging IT and OT endpoints, it enhances asset management and promotes application development. It can supplement traditional OT functions and pivot asset-intensive industries like manufacturing or energy towards digitalization. The IIoT platform should fulfill key requirements like security, automation, and sustainability. It enables interoperability with various business applications. Key capabilities include device management, integration, data management, analytics, application enablement, and security (see also [IIoT platform definition](https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2C757S9J&ct=230105&st=sb)). With its prowess in connecting and processing data from IIoT devices, Node-RED finds a fitting place in the sphere of IIoT platforms, becoming an integral tool in industries like manufacturing where the utility of such data is paramount for fostering operational efficacy and stimulating innovation. Further augmenting Node-RED's proficiency, FlowFuse introduces enterprise-grade features that streamline the management of remote deployments and delivery pipelines, thus amplifying Node-RED's and FlowFuse's potential as IIoT platform.


## Product Initiatives

An initiative explains our focus and areas of investment.

### Advancing Enterprise-Readiness

FlowFuse is committed to augmenting the enterprise-readiness of Node-RED. Our strategy emphasises enhancing audit and compliance capabilities, instituting stringent preventive and corrective controls, and bolstering security. By integrating these vital aspects, we aim to create a reliable, secure, and scalable environment. This initiative underlines our dedication to surpassing enterprise expectations and strengthening Node-RED's position in the industry.

### Node-RED Deployments at the Edge (Device Management)

Many organizations position Node-RED instances on remote servers, edge or industrial devices, to meet network, infrastructure, or use case requirements. Therefore, management of remote instances is crucial for the overall success of closing the gap between IT and OT. 

FlowFuse already supports this process by creating snapshots on Node-RED instances that can be deployed to multiple remote targets. We will continue to expand the functionalities to allow users to manage existing Node-RED instances, improve their development practices to accelerate development and ensure a reliable and repeatable process, providing more flexible remote deployment options and offering the best support for devices in closed and segmented networks as we are facing it in production environments.

### Enhanced Integration Capabilities

The "Node-RED Library" offers a unique added value to many Node-RED and FlowFuse users. It is already possible today to easily create technical implementations out of the box for several OT and IT protocols, thanks to the community and Node-RED library.

As a part of our evolution, FlowFuse plans to incorporate "custom nodes" into our product line. In this endeavour, we'll offer official support for selected popular nodes while also enabling the community to provide commercial nodes via FlowFuse. While maintaining an open-source core remains a priority, we believe that offering premium extensions and commercial support can encourage community participation in FlowFuse's success.

This integration strategy includes communication protocols, APIs, and application adapters. These elements will not only meet the data and process integration needs but also address enterprise application and IIoT ecosystem integration requirements across cloud and on-premises implementations, providing a comprehensive solution.

### Data Visualization & Analytics

FlowFuse's commitment to a low-programming approach via Node-RED, complemented by Node-RED Dashboard, allows for advanced data management and analytical functions. The Node-RED Dashboard provides a crucial interactive graphical user interface for Node-RED applications, allowing users to see data in a more visually engaging and understandable format. By processing and visualization of data, we will deliver insights into asset state, track patterns, and optimize asset use.

### User-Friendly Low-Code Approach

FlowFuse is built upon the strength of Node-RED's user-friendly, low-code approach, positioning us well within the IIoT market. We believe Node-RED provides the best foundation, but we're committed to not only utilizing its existing capabilities but also contributing to its upstream improvement. By refining Node-RED and adding enhancements, we aim to create an even more intuitive, powerful, and accessible platform. This will enable end-users to swiftly and intuitively build applications and reducing the dependency on expert programmers.
