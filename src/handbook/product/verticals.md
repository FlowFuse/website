# Product Verticals

## Background
Node-RED is best used for connecting _things_ together, and doing logic or manipulation of the data in that connection. Those things can be wide ranging from Web APIs using HTTP to physical hardware on serial connections.
FlowForge competes in specific market verticals which allow us to optimize for certain use-cases.

## Industrial IoT Platforms

Node-RED's ability to connect and process data from IoT device and close the gab between IT and OT aligns perfectly with this category. It is especially relevant in the manufacturing sector, where such data is vital for operational efficiency and innovation. FlowForge, by adding Enterprise features, helps in managing remote deployments and delivery pipelines, enhancing the overall capabilities of Node-RED as an IIoT platform.

However, the downside might be that currently it could be seen as too general-purpose and not specialized enough for specific IIoT tasks compared to other, more narrowly focused IIoT platforms.

### Market size

The Industrial IoT market is expected to reach a value of USD 516.6 Billion by 2028 (USD 221.7 Billion in 2022), with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.49% from 2023 to 2028.
And about [USD 66.5 Billion in 2022 in Software only](https://www.imarcgroup.com/industrial-iot-market). 

### Key customers

The primary customer base in the IIoT sector includes manufacturing, energy, transportation, and utilities companies. These businesses prioritize operational efficiency, equipment monitoring, predictive maintenance, and often operate on a global scale. They require a system that can handle large data volumes and enable swift, insightful decision-making.

### Positioning

FlowForge needs to leverage its enterprise features and aslo focus on providing an end-to-end IIoT solution. By promoting its capacity for device management and remote deployments, it can appeal to organizations seeking greater operational control and efficiency. Furthermore, forging partnerships with key industrial equipment manufacturers can help integrate FlowForge as part of a comprehensive IIoT solution.

## Low-Code Tools

Low-code platforms enable rapid application development with minimal hand-coding, which is precisely what Node-RED offers with its visual, drag-and-drop interface for creating flow-based applications. Node-RED allows users with little programming knowledge to create complex IoT applications, which again aligns well with FlowForge's focus on collaborative development and management of Node-RED applications.

The potential disadvantage is that low-code tools can sometimes be viewed as less powerful or flexible than full-code platforms, and the target customers are difficult to be named. 

### Market Size

The worldwide market for low-code development technologies is projected to total [$26.9 billion in 2023, with a growth of 19.6% from 2022](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-12-13-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-low-code-development-technologies-market-to-grow-20-percent-in-2023) (Low Code Tools USD 22,462 Billion in 2022; Low-Code Application Platforms (LCAP) only USD 7,968 Billion in 2022)

### Key customers

Businesses looking to accelerate digital transformation are the primary customers here, including both large enterprises and SMBs. These organizations need to quickly develop applications to streamline their operations, improve customer experiences, or launch innovative products.

### Positioning

FlowForge should position itself as a comprehensive low-code platform, ideal for both novices and experienced developers. This includes emphasizing its drag-and-drop interface for application building and the ability to scale and manage applications easily. A strong focus on community-building and providing an extensive library of pre-built components can help attract a wider user base.

## Data Integration Tools
Also known as IPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service) This market serves business users looking to integrate workflows across multiple different systems. Typically these are Cloud Hosted SaaS types of systems, usually with some sort of Public API.
There is also the scenario of integrating between cloud systems and internal company systems or data stores. 

However, while this is an important function of Node-RED, it doesn't encompass all the capabilities and the broader aim of FlowForge.

### Market size

The market size has been reported to be at least $1.4b in 2021. Potentially growing to [$12.3b in 2027](https://www.vynzresearch.com/ict-media/global-ipaas-market).

### Key customers

This category encompasses businesses in various sectors that deal with large data volumes, including e-commerce, financial services, healthcare, and supply chain management. They require a system that can consolidate data from multiple sources and make it accessible for analysis and decision-making.

### Competetors

Some of the companies that are in this market include:
- n8n.io
- Zapier
- IFTTT
- Dell Boomi
- OneReach.ai
- Microsoft Flow
- Workato
- Snap Logic
- tray.io
- Webmethods.io
- Mulesoft Anypoint
- Integromat
- UiPath
- HubSpot

### Positioning

FlowForge should highlight its capabilities as an advanced data integration platform, emphasizing its ability to simplify data collection and transmission. Showcasing partnerships with major database providers and cloud systems could enhance its appeal as a capable and versatile data integration tool.
