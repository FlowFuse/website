# Product Metrics

Our ongoing mission is to enable data-driven decision-making, facilitating strategic product development and enhancing user experience. To achieve this, we focus on specific product metrics that illuminate user behavior, feature adoption, and overall product performance. 

This handbook page provides an overview of the metrics we concentrate on, and how they contribute to our overall [product strategy](./strategy.md).

## Principles

#### Data-driven decision making 
Aligned with our value of [Results](../company/values.md#üìà-results), we are staunch advocates for data-driven decision-making. Instead of relying on assumptions or rushing decisions, we let data guide our actions to drive results.

#### Continuous learning and improvement
Consistent with [Iterative Improvement](../company/values.md#üîÅ-iterative-improvement), we believe even the smallest changes can contribute to our growth. We're committed to consistently reassessing, learning, and evolving based on the insights our data provides.

## Current Metrics

Each metric we track provides unique insights into different facets of our product. These metrics validate or disprove product hypotheses, guide product development, and assist in informed decision-making regarding feature improvements. The ultimate goal is always to create a product that fulfills the needs and preferences of our users. We focus on several key metrics that enable us to understand our product's use and the adoption of its various features. Here is a list of the current key metrics we track:

1. **Applications with Multiple Instances**: Applications were designed to group Node-RED instances for enhanced organization, thus serving as a foundational element for numerous other features.

2. **High Availability Adoption Rate**: This metric quantifies the proportion of active instances with activated [High Availability (HA)](https://flowforge.com/docs/user/high-availability/). It's calculated by dividing the number of HA instances by the total number of active instances.

3. **Overall Pipeline Adoption Rate**: This metric illustrates the degree of [pipeline](https://flowforge.com/docs/user/devops-pipelines/) adoption relative to applications, calculated by dividing the total number of pipelines by the total number of applications.

4. **Snapshot Adoption Rate**: This rate evaluates the prevalence of active instances using one or more [snapshots](https://flowforge.com/docs/user/snapshots/). It's determined by dividing the number of active instances with one or more snapshots by the total number of active instances.

5. **Device Adoption Rate**: This metric demonstrates the rate at which teams adopt [devices](https://flowforge.com/docs/user/devices/), determined by dividing the number of teams with one or more devices by the total number of teams.

6. **Weekly Active Users**: This fundamental metric provides insight into the overall usage and engagement with our product on a weekly basis.
