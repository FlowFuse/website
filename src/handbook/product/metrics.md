# Product Metrics

Our ongoing mission is to enable data-driven decision-making that facilitates strategic product development and enhances user experience. We achieve this by focusing on specific product metrics that help us understand user behavior, feature adoption, and the overall performance of our product. 

This handbook page provides an overview about the metrics we focus on, and how they contribute to our overall [product strategy](./strategy.md).

## Principles

In all our practices, we strive to keep things simple, to embrace change, and to apply the Pareto principle and the golden mean, finding the balance between minimal effort and maximum impact.

#### Data-driven decision making 
Aligned with our value of [Results](../../company/values.md#üìà-results), we strongly believe in data-driven decision making. Instead of making assumptions or taking hasty decisions, we use data as our guiding light to drive results.

#### Continuous learning and improvement
In line with [Iterative Improvement](../../company/values.md#üîÅ-iterative-improvement), we believe every change, no matter how small, can contribute to our growth. We're committed to continually reassessing, learning, and evolving based on the insights our data provides.

## Current Metrics

Each of the metrics we track offers unique insights into different facets of our product. They serve to validate or disprove product hypotheses, guide product development, and assist in informed decision-making regarding feature improvements. The ultimate aim is always to create a product that resonates with the needs and preferences of our users. We focus on several key metrics that allow us to understand the use of our product and the adoption of its various features. Here is a list of the current key metrics we track:

1. **Applications with multiple instances**: Applications were designed to group Node-RED instances for enhanced organization, thus serving as a foundational element for numerous other features.

2. **High Availability Adoption Rate**: This metric represents the proportion of active instances that have activated [High Availability (HA)](https://flowforge.com/docs/user/high-availability/). It is calculated by dividing the number of HA instances by the total number of active instances.

3. **Overall Pipeline Adoption Rate**: This measure reflects the degree to which [pipelines](https://flowforge.com/docs/user/devops-pipelines/) have been adopted in relation to applications. It is determined by dividing the total number of pipelines by the total number of applications.

4. **Snapshot Adoption Rate**: This adoption rate evaluates the prevalence of active instances that use one or more [snapshots](https://flowforge.com/docs/user/snapshots/). It is calculated by dividing the number of active instances with one or more snapshots by the total number of active instances.

5. **Device Adoption Rate**: This metric indicates the rate at which teams adopt [devices](https://flowforge.com/docs/user/devices/). It's determined by dividing the number of teams with one or more devices by the total number of teams.

6. **Weekly Active Users**: This is a fundamental metric for understanding the overall usage and engagement with our product on a weekly basis.
