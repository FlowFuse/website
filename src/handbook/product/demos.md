### Feature Demos

Feature demos are designed to enable rapid, asynchronous evaluation of newly developed features. These demos, which take the form of recorded videos, are open to the entire company. They are posted in the `#feature-demos` Slack channel to foster cross-functional learning and development.

Each feature demo is recorded by the developer responsible for the feature, detailing its functions and operations. If problems, challenges, or improvement ideas arise during the review of the demo, everyone is encouraged to post a comment under the video within the Slack channel. Additionally, a corresponding GitHub issue should be opened to track and prioritize these points for further discussion and action.

This dynamic process not only provides a transparent view of our feature development but also allows for an agile response to any potential areas of improvement, keeping our products in a constant state of enhancement and refinement.
