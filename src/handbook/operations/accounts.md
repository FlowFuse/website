# Accounts

These are the principles of how we setup and use accounts on the FlowFuse.cloud platform.

Shared accounts should be avoided wherever possible, particularly on our own systems as this removes the ability to track which individual made a change.

## User Accounts

All employees of Flowforge should have a user account on flowforge.cloud and be added to the `FlowFuse Team` in order to access our own company projects.
The email address for this account should be their normal @flowfuse.com address

## Admin

Where their role requires it they should have a separate admin account on flowforge.cloud in the format `username-admin` This account should not be a member of any teams and should only be used to administrate the service.

Because you can only have one account per email address on the platform admin accounts should have +admin added to the name eg `bob+admin@flowfuse.com` Google will then automatically forward those emails to the `bob@flowfuse.com` account.
