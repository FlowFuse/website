# Support

For FlowForge customers, there are two ways to get support, through support tickets
or go to the community forum. Where to go when is described below.

| Topic | Support venue |
|---|---|
| Billing | [Support ticket][support-tickets] |
| FlowForge Application | [Support ticket][support-tickets] |
| FlowForge Feature Requests | [FlowForge repository](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge/issues) |
| Node-RED Application | [Community Forum][support-forum] |
| Node-RED flows | [Community Forum][support-forum] |
| Custom nodes | [Community Forum][support-forum] |

If you're not a FlowForge customer, or in your trial phase, please go to the
[community forum][support-forum].

## Support Tickets

### HubSpot

We use HubSpot to manage our customer support tickets for the managed FlowForge platform. We can give each FlowForge team member access to HubSpot by assigning them a seat. 

If you wish to be granted access to HubSpot please post in the FlowForge
[#support-tickets](https://flowforgeworkspace.slack.com/archives/C031K13FLDD) Slack channel.

Whenever a customer raises a new ticket or replies with an update a message is
posted into slack #support-tickets.
This will allow the whole team visibility of customer issues, comments on the
Slack thread will be added to the ticket as notes.

When the customer has used the support widget you can communicate with that customer in real-time using the support-tickets Slack channel.

When replying to the ticket one should have the intent to always reply with links
to FlowForge articles or documentation. If these resources are missing, please
start or update where applicable.

HubSpot uses notes and responses within the thread, notes are internal and not sent to the customer, responses are sent to the customer.

We monitor the time since a ticket on HubSpot was last updated and send alerts to slack #support-tickets where those tickets have not been updated for longer than:

 - 1 day for customer created support tickets.

### Scope of Support

FlowForge customers will only get support for issues relating to the FlowForge
application or their account & billing. Any questions around Node-RED
itself or their flows should be redirected to the
[FlowForge Community forum][support-forum].

3rd party nodes are not supported at this time. It is reasonable to point a
customer direct to a repo for a 3rd party node question.

### SLA

Support will be available between during business hours (Berlin time zones)
Monday to Friday, with anything outside of those hours on a 'best effort' basis
unless the customer and FlowForge agreed otherwise.

### Escalation

Where the issue relates to a bug in the FlowForge application then the person
dealing with the ticket should aim to reproduce that bug and then raise an
appropriate issue in GitHub, The issue should reference the support ticket but
not mention the customer by name. Once raised the issue URL should be added to
the ticket and shared with the customer for visibility. The ticket should not be
closed until the bug is resolved.

## Community Forum

As the Node-RED forums are intended to be vendor neutral, FlowForge has a
[community forum][support-forum] too.

### Scope of Support

FlowForge customers will only get support for issues relating to the FlowForge
application or their account & billing. Any questions around Node-RED
itself or their flows should be redirected to the
[FlowForge Community forum][support-forum].

3rd party nodes are not supported at this time. It is reasonable to point a
customer direct to a repo for a 3rd party node question.
