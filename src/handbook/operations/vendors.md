# Vendors

In accordance with our
[Third-Party Risk Management policy](../company/security/third-party-risk-management.md)
all vendors should be reviewed to ensure their suitability for handling FlowFuse
data.

A list of approved vendors is available internally
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ro77wy0cRK6gpzVv_iq4vpdmbdMq61X5-tTwI_F3hXM/edit?usp=sharing){rel="nofollow"}.

For new vendors not on the list, get CEO approval and add any signed agreements
to
[this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1r6u1MNHZFAM1uhHmX-XtQs_bRcFVxQ25){rel="nofollow"}.

For the legal procedures and terms for our own customers, please
[read the corresponding handbook page](/handbook/sales/legal/).

### Vendor Selection and Evaluation
When selecting a new vendor, ensure that the choice is made deliberately to address the specific and immediate needs of each department. Conduct appropriate interviews and record them using Fathom to share with relevant stakeholders and interested parties involved in the decision-making process. Review the contract and budget and share your thoughts and opinion with the CEO. The final vendor selection will be approved by the CEO or CTO.
After the first 21 days of collaboration, request a performance review to evaluate alignment and satisfaction. FlowFuse encourages agile termination of contracts if the vendorâ€™s performance or results do not meet expectations, allowing quick adjustments when necessary.  
Team members are also encouraged to seek external support whenever workload or capacity issues might slow down company progress, as a qualified vendor can help accelerate results and maintain growth momentum.

### Process

To initiate the approval and payment process for invoices, suppliers should send
a PDF of the invoice to billing@flowfuse.com from a company email. FlowFuse pays
invoices 30 days after filing unless specifically agreed otherwise prior to
filing the invoice.

The invoice should include:

- Vendor Invoice ID
- Vendor address
- Vendor contact details
- Details of services rendered
- Amount of dollars due

When verifications are finalised, typically within a couple of business days,
the vendor will receive an email with details and next steps.

#### Fraud prevention

We do not diverge from this process regardless of the urgency of the payment. We
will _never_ make a payment request through direct email or text messages.

If in any doubt, reach out through Slack and request a call to validate.

## Legal Review Process

### Governing Law Requirements

FlowFuse only accepts governing law to be in Delaware, California, or Dutch
(Amsterdam) for any vendor agreement. We cannot agree to agreements with
governing law in other jurisdictions.
