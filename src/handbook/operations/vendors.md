# Vendors

In accordance with our [Third-Party Risk Management policy](../company/security/third-party-risk-management.md)
all vendors should be reviewed to ensure their suitability for handling FlowFuse
data.

A list of approved vendors is available interally [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ro77wy0cRK6gpzVv_iq4vpdmbdMq61X5-tTwI_F3hXM/edit?usp=sharing){rel="nofollow"}.

### Process

To start to process of approval and paying of invoices a PDF of the invoice should
be mailed to billing@flowfuse.com. FlowFuse pays invoices 30 days after filing 
unless specifically agreed otherwise prior to filing the invoice.

The invoice should include:
- Vendor Invoice ID
- Vendor address
- Vendor contact details
- Details of services rendered
- Amount of dollars due

#### Fraud prevention

We do not diverge from this process regardless of the urgency of the payment. We will _never_ make a payment request through direct email or text messages.

If in any doubt, reach out through Slack and request a call to validate.
