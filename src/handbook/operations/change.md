# FlowFuse Cloud Change Control

We track changes made to either the Staging or Production environments of FlowFuse Cloud
through issues on the CloudProject repository.

The issues should record the nature of the change required, which environment it applies to
and provide all of the necessary details to enact the change and to verify the change was successful.

1. Create a Change Request issue on the [CloudProject repository](https://github.com/FlowFuse/CloudProject/issues/new?assignees=&labels=change-request&template=change-request.yml&title=Change%3A+){rel="nofollow"}.
2. Obtain a review and approval to make the change from Engineering leadership - this should be done as a comment on the issue.
3. Assign the issue to the person making the change.
4. Once the change has been applied, verify the change is complete
5. Close the issue once verified


# FlowFuse Dedicated Instance Change Control

Changes to customer dedicated instances managed by FlowFuse should follow the same process 
as listed above for FlowFuse Cloud. The one difference is that the details of exactly which
instance the changes should be applied to.
