navTitle: OKRs

## The Executive Summary
Goal: A high-level reference for leadership and teams to ensure alignment at a glance.

# The OKR Philosophy
OKRs are not a performance management tool (HR) but a strategy execution framework. They exist to answer two questions: Where do we want to go? and How will we pace ourselves to see if we’re getting there?

## The Anatomy of Success
- Objectives (The North Star): Must be qualitative, inspirational, and clear. If it doesn’t get the team excited (or slightly nervous), it’s likely a task, not an objective.
    - It’s objective can have up to 5 Key Results. Ideally, you limit the number of Key Results between 3 and 4. 
- Key Results (The Pulse): These are the specific, time-bound markers that indicate progress. They are binary: at the end of the quarter, you either did it or you didn’t.
    - Rule of Thumb: If it’s not a number, it’s not a Key Result.
- The "Stretch" Culture: In Measure What Matters, Doerr highlights "Committed" vs. "Aspirational" OKRs.
    - Committed: 100% success is expected (a product launch).
    - Aspirational: High-risk, high-reward goals where 70% success is considered a win.

## Weekly Rhythm
OKRs are a living pulse. Teams should spend 10 minutes in every weekly meeting reviewing their Confidence Level (1–10) on whether they will hit their KRs by the end of the quarter.

# The Deep-Dive Best Practices Guide
Goal: An internal manual for managers to facilitate the process.

### 1. The "Measure What Matters" Framework
John Doerr identifies Four Superpowers that OKRs provide to an organization:
1. Focus: Identifying the 3–5 goals that actually move the needle.
2. Alignment: Connecting individual efforts to the CEO’s top-line goals.
3. Tracking: Using data to drive the conversation, not intuition.
4. Stretching: Pushing the boundaries of what the team thinks is possible.

### 2. Writing Workshop: From Good to Great
To write effective OKRs, avoid goals that lack depth.

- Avoid terms without numbers: Don't just say "Increase Sales."
- Test if it’ll help achieve the Objective: If you achieve this Key Result, will the business actually be better off?
- Input vs. Output: A common mistake is measuring inputs ("Send 1,000 emails") instead of outcomes ("Achieve 10% conversion rate from email outreach").

### 3. The Pitfalls & Guardrails
- Trying to capture 100% of your work in OKRs. OKRs should represent the 20% of work that will yield 80% of your growth.
- If employees are punished for missing "Aspirational" OKRs, they will stop being ambitious and start "sandbagging" (setting goals they know they can hit).
- If leadership sets all OKRs, the frontline teams lose a sense of ownership. Aim for a 50/50 split of top-down and bottom-up goal setting.

### 4. Standard Update Template & Example
When posting your monthly or bi-weekly update, use the following format

- Status: Not Started/On-Track/Off-Track/Achieved/Achieved Poorly
- Highlights: 
- Challenges/Blockers:
- Next Steps: 

### 5. The Lifecycle: Setting Up for the Quarter
Setting OKRs is a collaborative process between leadership and teams. It should begin 2–3 weeks before the new quarter starts.

1. Top-Down Guidance: Leadership shares the 3–5 "Global OKRs" for the company.
2. Bottom-Up Proposals: Managers review the Objectives and draft KRs with the support of their team.
3. Present the Objectives and KRs in a leadership meeting.
  - Optional: Conduct a survey to see if the team has more comments to share on the OKRs
4. Public Declaration: OKRs are published in a shared space (a dashboard or shared doc).

### 6. The OKR Timeline: A Sample 6-Week Cycle
To prevent the "start-of-quarter scramble," Measure What Matters advocates for a structured overlap:

1. Week -4 (One month before): Leadership begins drafting Company-level OKRs.
2. Week -2: Company OKRs are finalized and shared. Departments begin "The Linkage" (drafting their own goals in response).
3. Week -1: Alignment meetings to resolve dependencies between departments (Marketing needs Design’s help).
4. Week 1: All OKRs are locked and loaded in the tracking system.
5. Quarter End: Scoring and Post-Mortems occur, feeding directly into the next cycle’s planning.

### 7. Scoring and the Post-Mortem
At the end of the quarter, teams must "close the loop." This is where the learning happens.

#### The Scoring Scale

OKRs are typically scored on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0:
- 0.7 to 1.0 (Green): We delivered! (If it's always 1.0, you aren't stretching goals).
- 0.4 to 0.6 (Yellow): We made progress but fell short of the target.
- 0.0 to 0.3 (Red): We failed to make significant progress.

### The Post-Mortem
A scoring session without a post-mortem is just math. The team should meet for 60 minutes to answer:

- Contextual Scoring: If we got a 0.4 because the market shifted or we pivoted to a better goal, that’s a "good" 0.4. If we got it because of poor execution, that’s a "bad" 0.4.
- What did we learn? 
- Start/Stop/Continue: Should this KR roll over to next quarter, or should we kill it because it’s no longer relevant?
- Don’t forget to roll over some KRs to the following quarter. Even if they don’t live on the company level and only on the departmental level, we still need to complete this work. 

### 8. The Vertical Flow: From Company to Department
In traditional management, goals "cascade" down, often losing meaning by the time they hit the front lines. 

#### Phase 1: Setting the Company Level OKRs 
The CEO and the leadership team set the top-level OKRs. These should focus on the 3–5 most critical "must-wins" for the entire organization over the next 12 months (Annual OKRs) and the next 3 months (Quarterly OKRs).
- The Mission Link: Company OKRs must directly reflect the organization’s mission and long-term strategy.
- Visibility: These must be published where every single employee can see them.

#### Phase 2: The Departmental Response (Alignment)
Once Company OKRs are set, Department Heads look at the Company OKRs and ask: "How can my department most impact these specific results?"
Direct Alignment: A Department KR might be a literal subset of a Company KR. (If the Company KR is $10M in revenue, the Sales Dept KR might be $5M of that total).
Indirect Alignment: A Department Objective might support a Company Objective in spirit. (If the Company Objective is "Global Expansion," the HR Dept Objective might be "Build a world-class international recruiting engine.")

#### Phase 3: The 50/50 Rule (Bottom-Up)
This is a core Doerr principle: At least 50% of OKRs should be generated by the teams and individuals themselves. If everything is top-down, you get compliance but not "buy-in."
By allowing departments and teams to propose how they will contribute, you tap into the collective intelligence of the people closest to the customers and the code.


# The OKR Quality Control Center

## Checklist: Reviewing Your Draft OKRs
Use this list during your Bottom-Up Proposals to ensure the goals are high-quality.

- Is the Objective inspirational? (Does it sound like a mission, not a chore?)
- Are there 3–5 KRs per Objective? (More than 5 leads to diluted focus.)
- Are all KRs measurable? (If you can't put it in a spreadsheet, it’s not a KR.)
- Is there a mix of "Output" and "Outcome"? ("Launch feature" vs. "10% adoption rate".)
- Can the team control the outcome? (Don't set a KR that depends entirely on another team's work without their buy-in.)
- Is the "Stretch" clear? (Is this a safe bet or a push?)

## Checklist: The "Traps" to Avoid
Before confirming, verify that your OKRs haven't fallen into these common pitfalls.

- The To-Do List Trap: If your KRs look like a project plan (Task 1, Task 2), they are tasks, not results. Ask: "What is the impact of completing these tasks?" That impact is your KR.
- The Business as Usual Trap: If your OKRs describe 100% of your daily job, you’ve missed the point. OKRs are for incremental growth and change, not maintenance.
- The Low Target Trap: Teams setting low-bar targets to ensure they get a 1.0. This happens when OKRs are tied too closely to bonuses or salary reviews.
- The Set and Forget Trap: If there is no plan for a weekly check-in or update, the OKR is already dead.
- The Individual Team Trap: An OKR that helps your team but actively hurts another team (Sales hitting a volume KR that crashes the Engineering team’s servers).
- The Dependency Trap: Department A sets an OKR that requires Department B to do work Department B hasn't agreed to.
