## Expenses

FlowFuse will reimburse you for any work-related expenses that are considered
reasonable. The general principle to follow is to treat work-related expenses
**as if they were your own money**. It is important to seek good value for your
purchases and use common sense when making decisions.

There are two ways of spending company money - either using a company credit card,
or through reimbursement.

### Company Credit Card

We use [Brex](https://www.brex.com/) to provide cards to the team. They are, by
default, virtual Mastercards, although there is an option to get a physical
card sent out.

All expenses on Brex require a memo to be submitted with details on what the expense is for.
All expenses for $25 or more require a receipt to be uploaded. Attaching
a receipt to an expense can be done through their web UI, forwarding receipts
through email, or through Slack. For a full explanation, please [read their docs][brex-receipts].

Brex can also be used to create vendor cards that allow for reoccurring payment for a monthly subscription with a vendor.
Contact the peopleops manager if you require a vendor card.

#### Oops! Misused Your Brex Card for Personal Expenses? Here's How to Handle the Situation Like a Pro

If you realize that you have used your Brex card for personal purposes by mistake, it is crucial to promptly notify the People Ops Manager. The People Ops Manager is responsible for overseeing employee-related matters, including expenses and reimbursements. They will be able to assist you in addressing the situation appropriately. Contacting the People Ops Manager as soon as possible ensures that they are made aware of the mistake and can guide you on the necessary steps to rectify it, such as initiating reimbursement or repayment processes.

### Reimbursement

If you use your own means to purchase something that ought to be covered by the
company, you can claim back the money through [Deel](https://help.letsdeel.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4405497402257-How-Do-I-Add-An-Expense-Or-Allowance-To-My-Pay-).

* Create a new expense by clicking <kbd>Add item on the Payment Items tab on your Deel homepage</kbd>
* Enter the type of adjustment and select the Expense Category
* Enter a description, expense name, price and attach an invoice, then click <kbd>Submit</kbd>
* This expense will now appear in your "Pending" list
* Adjustments approved before the payroll cut-off date will be processed in the current month's payroll. Any adjustment approved after the payroll cut-off date will be processed in the next month's payroll
* The People Ops Manager is authorized to approve expenses that are $250 or less. However, if an expense exceeds $250, both the CEO and the People Ops Manager will need to review and approve it.

### Asset purchases over $500

Any asset purchase over $500 (laptops, devices etc) needs to be centrally recorded.
This is done in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sHJmUGG-m7y9TGrFrtqiZ6ubioLf1ySSam_cL-cmiRo/edit#gid=0)
and shared with the Finance team. Send details of the purchase to the PeopleOps Manager so 
it can be recorded.

### Education & Conferences

Continual professional development is very important, and FlowFuse will support
you in any activities you wish to undertake. Speak to your manager if you have
particular material you would like to study, or an event you would like to
attend. FlowFuse will help cover reasonable costs associated with the activity - such as travel and ticket fees.

### Software Licenses

Licenses and software assets can be purchased for third-party software will be useful for particular tasks, efforts and processes at FlowFuse.

If you are seeking a license of software that we do not currently use, put together a short summary as to the costs associated with the licenses and describe the value that the software would provide. If it would modify the way in which the company operates, then the best place to present this is as a PR to the Handbook. With approval from the CEO and CTO you can proceed with the acquisition of the licenses.

When seeking an additional license for existing software we pay for, file an issue in the [flowforge/admin][gh-admin]{rel="nofollow"} project to request it to be provisioned with a justification on the expenditure. Assign this issue to the CEO or CTO.

#### Zoom

When your role at FlowFuse requires you to have calls with external parties, a
Zoom pro license can be requested by opening an issue to provision you one
in the [flowforge/admin][gh-admin]{rel="nofollow"} GitHub project. Assign this issue to the CTO
or CEO, who will provision it for you.

### Workspace & Location

As an all remote company we don't have offices. It is envisaged that most people will work from their home the majority of the time. Equipment & Furniture required for a home workspace should be discussed with your manager as part of the hiring process.
The company covering certain costs, such as broadband can have tax implications depending on your local legislation. You should consult an independent advisor in your location for your particular situation.

#### Coworking space allowance

If you want to occasionally use a separate workspace to your home, the company
will cover up to $150 a month in charges for renting a desk in a co-working space
after manager approval.

#### Mileage

Use of a personal vehicle for business purposes, other than commuting to a permanent workplace, is covered according to the employees local laws.

For example:

 - [UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-travel-mileage-and-fuel-allowances/travel-mileage-and-fuel-rates-and-allowances) -  45p per Mile
 - [Netherlands](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/belastingdienst/zakelijk/auto_en_vervoer/auto_van_de_onderneming/autokosten/u_rijdt_in_uw_eigen_auto) - â‚¬0.19 per Km

A screenshot of the route and the total distance travelled should be included with any expense claim.
