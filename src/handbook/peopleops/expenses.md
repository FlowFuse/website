# Expenses

FlowFuse will reimburse you for any work-related expenses that are considered
reasonable. The general principle to follow is to treat work-related expenses
**as if they were your own money**. It is important to seek good value for your
purchases and use common sense when making decisions.

There are two methods available for using company funds: utilizing a company credit card or seeking reimbursement. If employees opt to use Brex for purchasing any company-related items or subscriptions, it is essential to upload the receipts and include a memo within three business days. For all reimbursement requests, please ensure to submit the required documentation and proofs through Deel.

## Company Credit Card

We use [Brex](https://www.brex.com/) to provide cards to the team. They are, by
default, virtual Mastercards, although there is an option to get a physical
card sent out.

Expenses on Brex require a memo and receipts. Memos explain the purpose of the expense, while receipts are necessary for expenses of $25 or more.
Receipts can be attached via the web UI, email, or Slack.
Please [read their docs][brex-receipts](https://www.brex.com/support/how-do-i-attach-receipts-to-brex-transactions/).

Brex can also be used to create vendor cards that allow for reoccurring payment for a monthly subscription with a vendor.
Contact the People Ops manager if you require a vendor card.

### Oops! Misused Your Brex Card for Personal Expenses? Here's How to Handle the Situation Like a Pro

If you realize that you have used your Brex card for personal purposes by mistake, it is crucial to promptly notify the People Ops Manager. The People Ops Manager is responsible for overseeing employee-related matters, including expenses and reimbursements. They will be able to assist you in addressing the situation appropriately. Contacting the People Ops Manager as soon as possible ensures that they are made aware of the mistake and can guide you on the necessary steps to rectify it, such as initiating reimbursement or repayment processes.

## Reimbursement

If you use your own means to purchase something that ought to be covered by the
company, you can claim back the money through [Deel](https://help.letsdeel.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4405497402257-How-Do-I-Add-An-Expense-Or-Allowance-To-My-Pay-).

* Create a new expense by clicking <kbd>Add item on the Payment Items tab on your Deel homepage</kbd>
* Enter the type of adjustment and select the Expense Category
* Enter a description, expense name, price and attach an invoice, then click <kbd>Submit</kbd>
* This expense will now appear in your "Pending" list
* Adjustments approved before the payroll cut-off date will be processed in the current month's payroll. Any adjustment approved after the payroll cut-off date will be processed in the next month's payroll
* The People Ops Manager is authorized to approve expenses that are $250 or less. However, if an expense exceeds $250, both the CEO and the People Ops Manager will need to review and approve it.

## Asset purchases over $500

Any asset purchase over $500 (laptops, devices etc) needs to be centrally recorded.
This is done in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sHJmUGG-m7y9TGrFrtqiZ6ubioLf1ySSam_cL-cmiRo/edit#gid=0)
and shared with the Finance team. Send details of the purchase to the PeopleOps Manager so 
it can be recorded.

## Education & Conferences

Continual professional development is very important, and FlowFuse will support
you in any activities you wish to undertake. Speak to your manager if you have
particular material you would like to study, or an event you would like to
attend. FlowFuse will help cover reasonable costs associated with the activity - such as travel and ticket fees.

## Software Licenses

Licenses and software assets can be purchased for third-party software will be useful for particular tasks, efforts and processes at FlowFuse.

If you are seeking a license of software that we do not currently use, put together a short summary as to the costs associated with the licenses and describe the value that the software would provide. If it would modify the way in which the company operates, then the best place to present this is as a PR to the Handbook. With approval from the CEO and CTO you can proceed with the acquisition of the licenses.

When seeking an additional license for existing software we pay for, file an issue in the [flowforge/admin][gh-admin]{rel="nofollow"} project to request it to be provisioned with a justification on the expenditure. Assign this issue to the CEO or CTO.

### Zoom

When your role at FlowFuse requires you to have calls with external parties, a
Zoom pro license can be requested by opening an issue to provision you one
in the [flowforge/admin][gh-admin]{rel="nofollow"} GitHub project. Assign this issue to the CTO
or CEO, who will provision it for you.

## Workspace & Location

As an all remote company we don't have offices. It is envisaged that most people
will work from their home the majority of the time. Equipment and furniture
required for a home workspace should be discussed with your manager as part of the hiring process. The company covering certain costs can have tax implications
depending on your local legislation. You should consult an independent advisor in
your location for your particular situation.

Employees can work from different countries or cities as long as their tax
residency remains the same at the time of hiring. Please inform your manager
before making such arrangements.

### Coworking space allowance

If you want to occasionally use a separate workspace to your home, the company
will cover up to $150 a month in charges for renting a desk in a co-working space
after manager approval.

### Mileage

Use of a personal vehicle for business purposes, other than commuting to a permanent workplace, is covered according to the employees local laws.

For example:

 - [UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-travel-mileage-and-fuel-allowances/travel-mileage-and-fuel-rates-and-allowances) -  45p per Mile
 - [Netherlands](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/belastingdienst/zakelijk/auto_en_vervoer/auto_van_de_onderneming/autokosten/u_rijdt_in_uw_eigen_auto) - â‚¬0.19 per Km

A screenshot of the route and the total distance travelled should be included with any expense claim.

## Personal expenses

We expect team members to take ownership of their personal expenses without the expectation of reimbursement. This approach is all about acknowledging personal preferences and recognising the individual benefits that come with these expenses. Here are some examples, but are not limited to:

1. Coffee at your home office
1. Passport for travel
1. Daycare for your children
