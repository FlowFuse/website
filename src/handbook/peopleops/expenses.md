## Expenses

FlowForge will reimburse you for any work-related expenses that are considered reasonable. This includes providing you with the necessary equipment, such as a laptop, monitor, and accessories, to effectively carry out your job responsibilities. As an all-remote company, our meetings are conducted using either Zoom or Slack. Therefore, we will also cover the expenses associated with obtaining a high-quality webcam, microphone, and lighting setup.

The general principle to follow is to treat work-related expenses as if they were your own money. It is important to seek good value for your purchases and use common sense when making decisions. If you find yourself in need of any equipment, it is advisable to have a discussion with your manager to explore the available options.

There are two methods available for using company funds: utilizing a company credit card or seeking reimbursement. If employees opt to use Brex for purchasing any company-related items or subscriptions, it is essential to upload the receipts and include a memo within three business days. For all reimbursement requests, please ensure to submit the required documentation and proofs through Deel.

### Company Credit Card

We use [Brex](https://www.brex.com/) to provide cards to the team. By default, the cards provided are virtual Mastercards, offering convenience and flexibility for online transactions. However, there is also an option available to request a physical card to be sent out if preferred.

Expenses on Brex require a memo and receipts. Memos explain the purpose of the expense, while receipts are necessary for expenses of $25 or more. Receipts can be attached via the web UI, email, or Slack. Please [read their docs][brex-receipts].

Brex can also be used to create vendor cards that allow for reoccurring payment for a monthly subscription with a vendor.
Contact the People Ops manager if you require a vendor card.

### Oops! Misused Your Brex Card for Personal Expenses? Here's How to Handle the Situation Like a Pro

If you realize that you have used your Brex card for personal purposes by mistake, it is crucial to promptly notify the People Ops Manager. The People Ops Manager is responsible for overseeing employee-related matters, including expenses and reimbursements. They will be able to assist you in addressing the situation appropriately. Contacting the People Ops Manager as soon as possible ensures that they are made aware of the mistake and can guide you on the necessary steps to rectify it, such as initiating reimbursement or repayment processes.

### Reimbursement

If you use your own means to purchase something that ought to be covered by the
company, you can claim back the money through [Deel](https://help.letsdeel.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4405497402257-How-Do-I-Add-An-Expense-Or-Allowance-To-My-Pay-).

* Create a new expense by clicking <kbd>Add item on the Payment Items tab on your Deel homepage</kbd>
* Enter the type of adjustment and select the Expense Category
* Enter a description, expense name, price and attach an invoice, then click <kbd>Submit</kbd>
* This expense will now appear in your "Pending" list
* Adjustments approved before the payroll cut-off date will be processed in the current month's payroll. Any adjustment approved after the payroll cut-off date will be processed in the next month's payroll
* The People Ops Manager is authorized to approve expenses that are $250 or less. However, if an expense exceeds $250, both the CEO and the People Ops Manager will need to review and approve it.

### Asset purchases over $500

Any asset purchase over $500 (laptops, devices etc) needs to be centrally recorded.
This is done in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sHJmUGG-m7y9TGrFrtqiZ6ubioLf1ySSam_cL-cmiRo/edit#gid=0)
and shared with the Finance team. Send details of the purchase to the PeopleOps Manager so 
it can be recorded.

### Education & Conferences

FlowForge recognizes the significance of continuous professional development, and we are committed to supporting you in your learning endeavors. If you have specific study materials you would like to explore or events you would like to attend, please discuss them with your manager. FlowForge will assist in covering reasonable expenses related to these activities, including travel and ticket fees.

### Software Licenses

Licenses and software assets can be purchased for third-party software will be useful for particular tasks, efforts and processes at FlowForge.

If you are seeking a license of software that we do not currently use, put together a short summary as to the costs associated with the licenses and describe the value that the software would provide. If it would modify the way in which the company operates, then the best place to present this is as a PR to the Handbook. With approval from the CEO and CTO you can proceed with the acquisition of the licenses.

When seeking an additional license for existing software we pay for, file an issue in the [flowforge/admin][gh-admin]{rel="nofollow"} project to request it to be provisioned with a justification on the expenditure. Assign this issue to the CEO or CTO.

#### Zoom

When your role at FlowForge requires you to have calls with external parties, a
Zoom pro license can be requested by opening an issue to provision you one
in the [flowforge/admin][gh-admin]{rel="nofollow"} GitHub project. Assign this issue to the CTO
or CEO, who will provision it for you.

### Workspace & Location

As an all-remote company without physical offices, the expectation is that most individuals will primarily work from their homes. When it comes to acquiring equipment and furniture for your home workspace, it is recommended to discuss these requirements with your manager during the hiring process. It's important to note that the company's coverage of certain costs, such as broadband expenses, may have tax implications depending on the local legislation in your area. To understand the specific tax implications relevant to your situation, it is advisable to consult an independent advisor familiar with the local tax regulations in your location.

#### Coworking space allowance

If you want to occasionally use a separate workspace to your home, the company
will cover up to $150 a month in charges for renting a desk in a co-working space
after manager approval.

#### Mileage

Use of a personal vehicle for business purposes, other than commuting to a permanent workplace, is covered according to the employees local laws.

For example:

 - [UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-travel-mileage-and-fuel-allowances/travel-mileage-and-fuel-rates-and-allowances) -  45p per Mile
 - [Netherlands](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/belastingdienst/zakelijk/auto_en_vervoer/auto_van_de_onderneming/autokosten/u_rijdt_in_uw_eigen_auto) - €0.19 per Km

A screenshot of the route and the total distance travelled should be included with any expense claim.
