## Code of Conduct

The primary goal of our Code of Conduct is to foster inclusive, collaborative
and safe working conditions for all FlowForge staff. As such, FlowForge is
committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all staff,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status,
or religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all FlowForge staff, as well
as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

### Scope 

The Code of Conduct applies to all FlowForge staff. This includes full-time,
part-time and contractor staff employed at every seniority level. The Code of
Conduct is to be upheld during all professional functions and events, including
but not limited to:

 - Working remotely and communicating on FlowForge resources with other team members.
 - At FlowForge-related extracurricular activities and events.
 - While attending conferences and other professional events on behalf of FlowForge.
 
We expect all FlowForge staff to abide by this Code of Conduct in all business
matters -- online and in-person -- as well as in all one-on-one communications
with customers and staff pertaining to FlowForge business.

This Code of Conduct also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the
scope of business activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely
affect the safety and well-being of FlowForge staff and clients.

### Culture and Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open citizenship by
encouraging participants to recognize the relationships between our actions and
their effects within FlowForge culture.

At the core are our [company values](../company/values.md). This Code of Conduct
makes explict how we should behave whilst uphold our values.

 - **Be inclusive**. We strive to be a company that welcomes and supports people
   of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members
   of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status,
   social and economic class, educational level, sexual orientation, gender
   identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion,
   and mental and physical ability.
 - **Be considerate**. Your work at FlowForge will be used by other people, and
   you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will
   affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account
   when making decisions.
 - **Be respectful**. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
   no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
   frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
   personal attack. It’s important to remember that a company where people feel
   uncomfortable or threatened is neither productive nor pleasant. FlowForge staff
   should always be respectful when dealing with other personnel as well as with
   people outside of FlowForge employment.

### Acceptable and Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all FlowForge staff:

 - Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the
   health and longevity of FlowForge.
 - Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions at all times.
 - Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 - Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
 - Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert FlowForge
   leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations
   of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

### Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

 - Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
 - Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
 - Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
 - Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
 - Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.

decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
