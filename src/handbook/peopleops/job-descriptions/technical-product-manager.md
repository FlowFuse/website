# Technical Product Manager

## Job Description

At FlowFuse, the Technical Product Manager (TPM) bridges product strategy and technical execution. They turn complex technical challenges into measurable product outcomes, ensuring engineering delivers solutions that meet customer needs and quality standards.

This role blends technical depth and product acumen. The TPM dives into architecture, weighs trade-offs, and uses data to guide decisions on debt, scalability, and performance.

The Technical Product Manager reports to the Director of Product and is primarily responsible for:
* Bridging strategy and execution: Translate product strategy into clear, measurable technical outcomes and objectives.
* Defining requirements: Partner with engineering to balance user needs, feasibility, and business impact.
* Delivering outcomes: Set success metrics/KPIs, measure progress, and connect decisions to results.

### Core Tasks and Responsibilities:
* Own metrics: Define, track, and report adoption, performance, reliability, and business impact.
* Plan sprints and releases: Align roadmap, priorities, debt, and infrastructure with product strategy.
* Shape specs/architecture: Co-create technical specs and provide architectural input.
* Translate across teams: Bridge product, engineering, sales, and customer success.
* Prioritize with data: Use usage data, customer feedback, and capacity signals.
* Assess feasibility: Evaluate complexity, approaches, and technical risk.
* Advocate quality: Set and monitor quality, performance, and reliability targets.

### What is the Technical Product Manager not responsible for?

- Writing production code or implementing features directly.
- Managing engineers or individual performance.
- Final technical architecture decisions (owned by CTO/engineering leadership).
