# Design Engineer

## Job Description

Design Engineers at FlowFuse bridge the gap between **product design** and **front-end engineering**, combining UX with technical expertise to deliver better holistically considered user experiences faster.

This is a true hybrid role requiring equal mastery of both product design and technical aptness in code—you'll design high-level concepts in Figma AND you will move quickly to try out ideas in code with the potential to implement or aid in implementing them into production. You should be as comfortable in design tooling as you are on the command line and in an IDE.

As a Design Engineer, you'll own user journeys end-to-end, from initial concept through final implementation. You'll work with your team to develop quick iterations on ideas, shifting between responsibilities for UX, Product, and Development—filling gaps where necessary by conducting user research, journey mapping, UI and systems design, prototyping, roadmapping, and development while staying the main advocate for the user's perspective.

You'll leverage AI tools strategically to explore design directions, generate functional prototypes or implementations, and iterate rapidly. This accelerates the team's velocity without compromising quality or implementation.

You value craft and attention to detail. You collaborate naturally across disciplines. You're comfortable leading product design work while having the technical skills to prototype and implement when the situation demands it. You can advocate passionately for users while understanding the technical realities of building great products.

Design Engineers at FlowFuse set the standard and vision for user-centered design while thinking and working cross-functionally. You'll influence how the organization balances user needs, design excellence, and engineering constraints—ensuring we build products that users love and that teams can actually ship.

## Responsibilities

- **Visual and interaction design**: Create interfaces in Figma that solve real user problems while maintaining visual excellence
- **Design system development**: Build and maintain design system components with meticulous attention to detail, polish, and interaction design
- **AI-accelerated prototyping**: Leverage AI tools for design exploration, code generation, and rapid prototyping to increase team velocity
- **Front-end implementation support**: Build prototypes with AI-assisted tools AND step in to implement features when front-end engineering capacity is needed
- **Performance, accessibility and interaction design**: Advocate for and define accessibility improvements including interactions and performance related
- **Product strategy contribution**: Participate in scoping, roadmapping, feature prioritization, and product planning discussions in line with business needs
- **Cross-functional gap filling**: Step in where needed across UX, Product, and Engineering to keep projects moving forward
- **Technical-design translation**: Bridge design and engineering teams, ensuring designs are both beautiful and implementable
