# Design Engineer

## Job Description

Design Engineers at FlowFuse bridge the gap between **product design** and **front-end engineering**, combining UX with technical expertise to deliver better holistically considered user experiences faster.

This is a true hybrid role requiring equal mastery of both product design and technical aptness in code—you'll design high-level concepts in Figma AND you will move quickly to try out ideas in code with the potential to implement or aid in implementing them into production. You should be as comfortable in design tooling as you are on the command line and in an IDE.

As a Design Engineer, you'll own user journeys end-to-end, from initial concept through final implementation. You'll work with your team to develop quick iterations on ideas, shifting between responsibilities for UX, Product, and Development—filling gaps where necessary by conducting user research, journey mapping, UI and systems design, prototyping, roadmapping, and development while staying the main advocate for the user's perspective.

You'll leverage AI tools strategically to explore design directions, generate functional prototypes or implementations, and iterate rapidly. This accelerates the team's velocity without compromising quality or implementation.

You value craft and attention to detail. You collaborate naturally across disciplines. You're comfortable leading product design work while having the technical skills to prototype and implement when the situation demands it. You can advocate passionately for users while understanding the technical realities of building great products.

Design Engineers at FlowFuse set the standard and vision for user-centered design while thinking and working cross-functionally. You'll influence how the organization balances user needs, design excellence, and engineering constraints—ensuring we build products that users love and that teams can actually ship.
