# DevOps Engineer

## Job Description

The DevOps Engineer at FlowFuse plays a critical role in building and maintaining the infrastructure that powers FlowFuse, ensuring reliability, scalability, and security for our customers' industrial automation and IIoT solutions. Additionally, a DevOps Engineer at FlowFuse should always be practicing our [Iterative Improvement](../../company/values.md#üîÅ-iterative-improvement) value, seeking areas for automation and refinement in our own internal practices and processes. 

This role combines deep technical expertise, with a customer-focused mindset, to ensure reliable infrastructure and automation, as well as establishing a close relationship and collaboration with our engineering teams to create robust, automated systems that enable our engineering teams to deliver value quickly and reliably.

As a DevOps Engineer, you'll be responsible for building and managing our cloud infrastructure, automating deployment processes, and building tools that improve both developer productivity and customer experience. You'll work closely with our engineering teams to understand their needs and translate them into ideas on how automation can help them. This position requires a balance of technical depth, automation expertise, and strong collaboration skills to support both FlowFuse customers and internal engineering teams.

Key Responsibilities:

* **Infrastructure Management & Automation**: Design, implement, and maintain AWS-based infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. Build and maintain CI/CD pipelines that enable rapid, reliable deployments while maintaining high security standards.
* **Platform Reliability & Monitoring**: You should have your finger on the pulse of the health of the platform at all times, and be able to implement comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting systems to ensure platform stability and performance. Develop automated incident response procedures and conduct root cause analysis for production issues.
* **Developer Experience & Tooling**: Build and maintain development tools, automation scripts, and internal services that improve developer productivity and reduce friction in the development process. This should be a key focus of the role, you should be an amplifier of those around you by removing friction with automation, and you should always be seeking to identify areas for refinement in our own internal practices and processes.
* **Security & Compliance**: Implement security best practices across all infrastructure components, ensuring compliance with industry standards, security policies, and customer requirements.
* **Customer-Focused Operations**: Respond to incidents quickly, and understand the needs of our customers, iterating on onboarding processes for FlowFuse Self-Hosted and Dedicated, reducing friction and improving the customer experience. 
* **Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing**: Work closely with engineering teams to understand their infrastructure needs, provide technical guidance, and share knowledge through documentation and mentoring. Ensure we are learning from incidents when they happen, document our learnings and implement changes to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

## Skills

The DevOps Engineer skill set includes:

### Must Have

* **Cloud Infrastructure Expertise**: 4-6 years of hands-on experience with AWS services including EC2, EKS, RDS, S3, CloudFront, and IAM. Strong understanding of cloud architecture patterns and best practices.
* **Kubernetes Proficiency**: Experience with Kubernetes API, container orchestration, and managing containerized applications in production environments.
* **Node.JS & JavaScript**: Solid experience with Node.JS development and JavaScript ecosystem, enabling effective collaboration with our engineering teams.
* **CI/CD & Automation**: Proven experience building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or similar platforms.
* **Infrastructure as Code**: Experience with Terraform, CloudFormation, or similar IaC tools for managing cloud infrastructure.
* **Monitoring & Observability**: Experience implementing monitoring solutions using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, or similar observability platforms.
* **Linux System Administration**: Strong Linux skills including shell scripting, system configuration, and troubleshooting.
* **Git & Version Control**: Proficiency with Git workflows and collaborative development practices.

### Nice to Have

* **Database Management**: Experience with PostgreSQL, MySQL, or other database systems including backup, recovery, and performance optimization.
* **Security Best Practices**: Knowledge of security frameworks, vulnerability management, and compliance requirements (SOC 2, ISO 27001).
* **Multi-cloud Experience**: Experience with other cloud providers (Azure, GCP) or hybrid cloud environments.
* **Industrial/IIoT Background**: Understanding of industrial automation protocols, edge computing, or IoT device management.
* **Python/Go Development**: Additional programming language experience for building internal tools and automation scripts.
* **Team Leadership**: Experience mentoring junior engineers or leading infrastructure initiatives in larger teams.
