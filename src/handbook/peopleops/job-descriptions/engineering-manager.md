# Engineering Manager

## Job Description

At FlowFuse, an Engineering Manager leads and grows our team of engineers. You'll need a strong technical background to effectively guide the team and make informed decisions, but your primary focus will be on leadership, coaching, and scaling the team to drive higher performance and faster innovation.

We believe in running our engineering team like a sports team. You'll be responsible for fostering a culture of high performance, continuous improvement, and a relentless drive to win.

As an Engineering Manager, you'll be shaping our engineering culture and driving the execution of our product roadmap. You will:
* **Coach and Develop Your Team**: You'll be responsible for the growth and development of your engineers. This includes conducting regular one-on-ones, providing constructive feedback, identifying areas for improvement, managing performance, and creating opportunities for career advancement. You'll know your team's strengths and weaknesses and how to best utilize their talents.
* **Drive Performance and Velocity**: You’ll do whatever is in your power to increase team performance and velocity. You'll establish clear goals and metrics, track progress, and implement strategies to help the team move faster and more efficiently without sacrificing quality. You will analyze the team's current performance, identify bottlenecks, and implement solutions to optimize our development processes.
* **Build a Winning Culture**: You will cultivate a high-performance, results-oriented environment. This means fostering a sense of ownership, accountability, and a shared commitment to our goals.
* **Strategize and Execute**: You'll work closely with other stakeholders to translate business objectives into a clear technical roadmap. You will be responsible for the successful and timely delivery of user-valuable software.
* **Provide Technical Leadership**: Your engineering background enables you to guide technical decisions, conduct code reviews, and mentor the team effectively. While writing code isn't your primary responsibility, your hands-on experience allows you to understand the technical challenges your team faces and make informed architectural decisions.

## Skills
To be successful in this role, you'll need a blend of technical prowess and leadership skills. You should bring to the table:

* **Solid Engineering Background**: You've walked the walk and have hands-on experience building software. Your background in software development gives you credibility with the team and enables you to make informed technical decisions. Familiarity with our tech stack (Node.js, Node-RED, Vue.js, DevOps tooling) is valuable but not essential—what matters most is that you've been in the trenches and understand what engineers face daily.
* **A Growth-Oriented Leader**: You have startup experience, and a track record of building and scaling high-performing engineering teams.
* **A Performance-Driven Mindset**: You are data-driven and have experience implementing and tracking metrics to improve team performance. You're constantly looking for ways to optimize processes and increase efficiency.
* **An Excellent Communicator**: You can clearly articulate technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences. You are a great listener and can build strong relationships with your team and other stakeholders.
* **A "Sports Team" Captain**: You understand the dynamics of a high-performing team. You know how to foster collaboration, healthy competition, and a shared will to win. You lead by example and inspire your team to perform at their best.
