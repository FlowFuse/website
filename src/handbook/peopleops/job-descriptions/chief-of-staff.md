This role is ideal for someone who thrives in a fast-paced environment, can seamlessly switch between high-level strategic thinking and hands-on execution, and possesses exceptional interpersonal and communication skills.

* Undertake ad-hoc projects and assignments as required, demonstrating flexibility and adaptability

## Skills
* Experience in a high-growth startup, management consulting, investment banking, venture capital, or a similar fast-paced environment
* Proven experience in project management, strategic planning, and operational execution
* Prior experience in a Chief of Staff or Founder's Associate role is helpful
* AI Native: Constantly looking for opportunities to improve organizational efficiency with AI and other tools
* Strategic & Analytical Thinking: Ability to quickly grasp complex concepts, synthesize information, and develop actionable insights
* Exceptional Communication: Superior written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to articulate complex ideas clearly and concisely to diverse audiences
* Project Management: Strong organizational skills with the ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously, prioritize effectively, and meet tight deadlines
* Proactivity & Initiative: Self-starter with a strong sense of ownership and the ability to anticipate needs and act independently
* Interpersonal Savvy: High emotional intelligence and the ability to build rapport and influence across all levels of an organization
* Adaptability & Resilience: Comfortable navigating ambiguity and change in a dynamic environment

## 90-Day Plan
* Week 1-4:
   * Immerse yourself in the company's product, strategy, and market landscape
   * Build foundational relationships with key stakeholders, including the leadership team, department heads, and direct reports to the CEO
   * Familiarize yourself with current operational processes, key strategic initiatives, and immediate priorities of the CEO
   * Review existing dashboards and reporting structures to understand key metrics
   * Take over any existing recruiting processes
* Week 5-8:
   * Begin to take ownership of specific projects outside recruiting, acting as a direct liaison for the CEO
   * Identify and propose initial improvements to communication flows, meeting cadences, or operational efficiencies
   * Start preparing materials for executive meetings and assist in follow-up and accountability tracking
   * Conduct initial deep dives into areas identified as high-priority by the CEO
