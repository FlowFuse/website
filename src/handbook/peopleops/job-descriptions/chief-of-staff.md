# Chief of Staff

## Job Description
The Chief of Staff (or Founder's Associate, as the role is often known in Europe) is the trusted right-hand person to our CEO. This pivotal role offers unparalleled exposure to all facets of our business, rapid professional growth, and the chance to significantly impact our strategic direction and operational efficiency.

This role is ideal for someone who thrives in a fast-paced environment, can seamlessly switch between high-level strategic thinking and hands-on execution, and possesses exceptional interpersonal and communication skills. This role provides a holistic view of building and scaling a successful company. This role is not an extension of an Executive Assistant role.

The Chief of Staff is always located in the CEO's timezone. This is always a hard requirement for the role.

You:
* Lead and manage key strategic projects from conception to completion, often cross-departmental and high-priority, on behalf of the CEO

* Act as a central point of contact for internal and external stakeholders, filtering and prioritizing information flow to the CEO
* Draft and prepare internal and external communications, presentations, and reports for the CEO, including investor communications and tech communication
* Act as a thought partner and sounding board for the CEO on various business challenges and opportunities
* Undertake ad-hoc projects and assignments as required, demonstrating flexibility and adaptability

## Skills
* Experience in a high-growth startup, management consulting, investment banking, venture capital, or a similar fast-paced environment
* Proven experience in project management, strategic planning, and operational execution
* Prior experience in a Chief of Staff or Founder's Associate role is helpful
* AI Native: Constantly looking for opportunities to improve organizational efficiency with AI and other tools
* Strategic & Analytical Thinking: Ability to quickly grasp complex concepts, synthesize information, and develop actionable insights
* Exceptional Communication: Superior written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to articulate complex ideas clearly and concisely to diverse audiences
* Project Management: Strong organizational skills with the ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously, prioritize effectively, and meet tight deadlines
* Proactivity & Initiative: Self-starter with a strong sense of ownership and the ability to anticipate needs and act independently
* Interpersonal Savvy: High emotional intelligence and the ability to build rapport and influence across all levels of an organization
* Adaptability & Resilience: Comfortable navigating ambiguity and change in a dynamic environment

## 90-Day Plan
* Week 1-4:
   * Immerse yourself in the company's product, strategy, and market landscape
   * Build foundational relationships with key stakeholders, including the leadership team, department heads, and direct reports to the CEO
   * Familiarize yourself with current operational processes, key strategic initiatives, and immediate priorities of the CEO
   * Review existing dashboards and reporting structures to understand key metrics
   * Take over any existing recruiting processes
* Week 5-8:
   * Begin to take ownership of specific projects outside recruiting, acting as a direct liaison for the CEO
   * Identify and propose initial improvements to communication flows, meeting cadences, or operational efficiencies
   * Start preparing materials for executive meetings and assist in follow-up and accountability tracking
   * Conduct initial deep dives into areas identified as high-priority by the CEO
* Week 9-13:
   * Fully integrate into the executive team's rhythm, proactively identifying opportunities to add value and streamline work
   * Lead at least one cross-functional initiative from planning to initial execution
   * Establish a clear system for prioritizing and managing the CEO's key strategic initiatives
   * Develop a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and strategic partnerships

## Hiring Plan
* Initial Screening: Review resumes and cover letters to assess candidate qualifications and experience
