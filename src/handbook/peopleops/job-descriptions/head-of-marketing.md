# Head of Marketing

## Job Description

The Head of Marketing is responsible for building and executing a measurable, outcome-driven marketing engine that directly supports company growth. This role is not purely strategic — it is delivery-oriented, KPI-led, and deeply connected to revenue, pipeline, and product adoption.

A leader who understands how to translate complex industrial and technical products into compelling narratives, while also owning execution across content, campaigns, and events. This person will balance strategic direction with hands-on leadership, ensuring marketing initiatives are delivered on time, measured rigorously, and continuously improved.

The Head of Marketing will work closely with Sales, Product, and Leadership to align go-to-market execution with FlowFuse’s growth objectives, supporting the full funnel from awareness through expansion.

## Core Responsibilities

### Marketing Strategy & Execution
- Own the end-to-end marketing strategy with a strong focus on execution and measurable outcomes.
- Translate company and revenue goals into clear marketing plans, campaigns, and initiatives.
- Ensure marketing efforts are tightly aligned with Sales, Product, and GTM priorities.

### KPI Ownership & Performance Management
- Define, track, and report on core marketing KPIs.
- Use data to prioritize initiatives, adjust campaigns, and improve overall marketing effectiveness.
- Establish clear accountability for results across all marketing programs.

### Content & Thought Leadership
- Oversee content-driven marketing efforts, including blogs, case studies, product narratives, and thought leadership.
- Ensure content supports awareness, consideration, adoption, and expansion use cases.
- Partner with Product and Engineering to translate technical capabilities into clear, outcome-oriented messaging.

### Events & Field Marketing
- Plan and execute industry events, conferences, webinars, and partnerships that support pipeline and brand credibility.
- Own event strategy from planning through post-event follow-up and ROI measurement.
- Coordinate closely with Sales on event-driven opportunities and account engagement.

### Cross-Functional Collaboration
- Act as a key partner to Sales on enablement, campaign alignment, and feedback loops.
- Collaborate with Product on launches, messaging, and market insights.
- Feed structured learnings back into Leadership to inform GTM and company strategy.

## Skills

### What We’re Looking For
- Proven experience leading marketing in a B2B SaaS or technology startup environment.
