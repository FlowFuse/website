# Fullstack Engineer

## Job Description

At FlowFuse, a Fullstack Engineer builds end-to-end product features across frontend and backend systems. This role is for an engineer who is comfortable working across the stack and who understands that technical decisions directly impact how users experience the product.

You will collaborate closely with Product, Design, and other engineers to deliver reliable, scalable features. While this role is not a design position, we expect Fullstack Engineers at FlowFuse to consider usability, clarity, and user workflows when building product features.

A Fullstack Engineer is primarily responsible for:
* **End-to-End Feature Delivery**: Building and maintaining fullstack product features from frontend to backend.
* **User-Aware Engineering**: Considering user experience, workflows, and clarity when implementing solutions.
* **Frontend and Backend Contribution**: Contributing meaningfully across UI, APIs, and services.
* **Incremental Delivery**: Shipping small, well-scoped changes frequently.
* **Collaboration**: Working closely with Product, Design, and Engineering peers.

Core Tasks and Responsibilities:
* Implement frontend features using Vue and TypeScript.
* Build and extend backend services and APIs using Node.js.
* Participate in code reviews, planning, and technical discussions.
* Identify usability improvements and raise them proactively.
* Ensure code is secure, observable, and maintainable.
* Contribute to improving architecture, tooling, and developer experience.

### What is the Fullstack Engineer not responsible for?

- Defining product strategy or roadmap priorities.
- Owning visual design or branding decisions.
- Managing people or performance.
- Sales, pricing, or go-to-market decisions.

## Skills

What a Fullstack Engineer brings to the table:
* Strong experience working across the full stack.
* Experience with modern frontend frameworks (Vue preferred, React acceptable).
* Working knowledge of backend development with Node.js and APIs.
* Ability to consider user workflows and usability while building features.
* Comfort working in a remote, async-first environment across multiple time zones.
* Comfort using AI tools to accelerate development and reduce manual effort.

## Hiring Plan

1. Resume Review: Review resumes and relevant experience. Done by the hiring manager.
1. Screening Call (15m): Initial screener focused on role fit, communication, and alignment with how FlowFuse works. Conducted by the hiring manager or recruiter.
1. Engineering Manager Call (45m): A deeper alignment conversation covering where FlowFuse is today, where it is going, how the team works, and mutual expectations for the role.
1. Take-Home Assignment (2–3 hours, unpaid): Candidates choose one of the following options. Both are explicitly timeboxed to 2–3 hours.
   - Option A: Contribute a small, scoped pull request to Node-RED or a related open-source project.
   - Option B: Build a small fullstack application (pizza ordering app).
   - Note: AI tools are explicitly allowed and encouraged where appropriate.
1. Technical Interview (60m): Review the take-home work with 2–3 team members from engineering and, where relevant, product or design. The discussion focuses on problem understanding, decisions and tradeoffs, structure and clarity, and how the solution would evolve over time rather than feature completeness. There will be explicit discussion of where AI was used, how it was used, and why those choices were made.
1. STAR Interview (45mins): A behavioral interview to understand past experiences and assess alignment with FlowFuse's values, initiative, and collaboration style. Conducted by the CEO.
1. Team Interview (45m): Conversation focused on team collaboration, communication style, and culture fit.
