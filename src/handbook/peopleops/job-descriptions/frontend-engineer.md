## Job Description

The Frontend Engineer at FlowFuse plays a critical role in building and maintaining the user experiences that drive customer satisfaction, ensuring intuitive, responsive, and performant interfaces for our customers.

This role requires deep technical expertise in modern frontend technologies, along with an empathy for the user. This role requires a customer-focused mindset to create engaging, accessible interfaces. The ideal candidate is someone that is able to bring a feature from being an idea to reality in the FlowFuse product. Someone that displays a high level of ownership and delivers well-tested, high quality work. As a small company you will work closely with the CTO and the whole engineering team. We need someone who is able to work independently, with good communication skills to work in our all-remote environment.

As a Frontend Engineer, you'll be responsible for building and maintaining our Vue.js & Node.js-based applications, contributing to [FlowFuse Dashboard](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/) and ensuring a robust test suite to ensure reliability across our front-end code base. With a key eye for design, you'll be able to propose improvements to the user experience and design of the product, as well as using your engineering experience to improve developer experience too.

Key Responsibilities:

* **Feature Development & Maintenance**: Design, build, and maintain features in FlowFuse, Node-RED, and FlowFuse Dashboard. Create responsive, accessible interfaces that work seamlessly across different devices and browsers.
* **Data Visualization**: Develop interactive data visualization components using modern charting libraries.
* **User Experience**: Propose designs and improvements to the user experience of the product. Collaborate with the wider team and customers to understand friction points and improve the user experience.

* **Community Engagement**: Engage with the open source community to triage feedback, review pull requests and address issues.
* **Performance Optimization**: Optimize frontend performance and developer experience, ensuring fast, responsive user interfaces that work well even with large quantities of assets.
* **Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing**: Work closely with engineering teams to understand their infrastructure needs, provide technical guidance, and share knowledge through documentation and mentoring. Ensure we are learning from user feedback and implementing changes to improve the overall user experience.
