All employees at FlowFuse will find HR policies in this section of the handbook. Please note that this section of the handbook will be continuously updated to reflect the evolving needs of our organization. As FlowFuse is actively in the process of developing and incorporating additional policies, we encourage you to check back regularly for the latest updates. Your familiarity with these policies ensures that you stay informed and aligned with our company's values and practices.

## Grievance Procedure

We're all about making FlowFuse an great place to work for everyone, however if you ever run into any concerns while you're here, these guidelines are here to help you out in raising a grievance. 

This procedure applies to all employees and full-time contractors regardless of length of service. It does not apply to ad-hoc freelancers.

**Step 1: Informal Resolution**

Should an employee have a grievance, we encourage them to first attempt an informal resolution by discussing the matter with their immediate manager. If your manager is not aware or if the matter requires escalation, our People Ops Manager is available to assist. This step is intended to achieve a swift and amicable resolution.

**Step 2: Submitting Grievance via Email**

If the employee is not satisfied with the result of the informal resolution or is hesitant to approach their immediate manager, they can escalate the matter by sending a formal grievance via email to the People Ops Manager. The email should comprehensively outline the problem, include pertinent details, and provide any available evidence that support the grievance.

**Step 3: Investigation**

Upon receipt of a formal grievance, the People Ops Manager will initiate an unbiased investigation. This might entail conversations with the concerned employee, pertinent witnesses, and a review of relevant documentation.

**Step 4: Resolution**

After the investigation, the People Ops Manager will focus on finding a fitting solution. This might include making things right, changing policies, or taking other steps to address the concern. FlowFuse aims to provide a solution within 10 days from when the employee submits their first formal grievance. Please be aware that sometimes, unforeseen circumstances can cause delays in the investigation. However, rest assured that FlowFuse is committed to resolving it as soon as possible.

**Step 5: Appeal**

If the grievance has not been resolved to your satisfaction you may appeal in writing an email to the CEO and the People Ops Manager, stating your full grounds of appeal including any additional information or arguments, within one week of the date on which the decision was sent or given to you.

**Step 6: Final Review**

We'll schedule an appeal meeting, typically within two weeks of receiving your appeal. This meeting will be conducted impartially by someone who was not previously engaged with the case. Following the appeal hearing, we'll provide our final decision, usually within one week. Unfortunately, there won't be any additional opportunity for appeal beyond this point.

**Confidentiality**

FlowFuse is firmly committed to preserving the confidentiality of all parties involved throughout the grievance process. This commitment holds while conducting a comprehensive investigation and implementing any required corrective actions.

**Non-Retaliation**

FlowFuse strictly prohibits any form of retaliation against employees who raise grievances in good faith. Any acts of retaliation will be treated as distinct violations of company policy.

This Grievance Policy is designed to ensure that employee concerns are treated fairly and promptly. FlowFuse is unwavering in its dedication to fostering an inclusive and respectful workplace and will consistently refine its policies and practices based on feedback and evolving industry standards.

## Underperformance Policy

FlowFuse strives to maintain high standards of performance across the entire organization and supports team members and people leaders in meeting those standards. Regular and transparent communication is encouraged across all areas of the business. FlowFuse also recognizes that team members who do not meet sustained performance expectations may be more successful at another company and supports difficult conversations and decisions related to this. It is essential to highlight that during this process, close collaboration with the People Ops manager is crucial.

**Defining Underperformance**

Identifying warning signs or patterns of underperformance in employees is crucial for effective management and timely intervention to address issues. Here are some common indicators to watch for:

Consistently Missed Deadlines
Decline in Productivity
Increased Errors and Mistakes
Lack of Initiative
Low Engagement and Motivation
Frequent Absenteeism or Tardiness
Poor Communication
Lack of Goal Achievement
Decreased Innovation and Creativity
Isolation from Team

**Addressing Underperformance**

Managers should first address areas of poor performance or behavioral concerns verbally in one-on-one with team members. These conversations should be documented by managers and shared to the CEO and the People Ops Manager. This allows everyone to keep a record of their discussions and be clear about where improvements need to be made and by when.

When documenting instances of underperformance, reporting managers should meticulously record specific details, including the date, time, location, a description of the incident, impact, and any witnesses. It is crucial for the reporting manager to promptly inform the People Ops manager of these documented cases for further evaluation and support.

Ensure that the employee comprehends your expectations and identifies areas necessitating improvement. Provide comprehensive guidance on the tasks involved and the performance standards expected from them. Maintain documentation outlining the set objectives and instances where the employee falls short to prevent any potential misunderstandings. In essence, specifying precise job requirements aids the employee in maintaining a clear focus on their objectives.

**Developing an Action Plan**

After engaging in a discussion with the employee regarding the factors contributing to their underperformance, both parties can collaborate to formulate an action plan aimed at resolving the issues. This collaborative effort involves making suggestions to address the problem and motivating the employee to establish goals and generate their own recommendations.

Depending on the root causes of underperformance, consider exploring opportunities for job redesign or providing retraining and reskilling. If the issues are of a personal nature, proposing the option of taking time off to address them may be appropriate.

The action plan should encompass several key elements:

*Assignment of Responsibilities:* Clearly outline the actions and responsibilities of both the employee and the employer.

*Performance Improvement Timeline:* Establish a timeframe for achieving the desired performance improvements, including potential consequences for addressing serious issues.

*Support and Resources:* Specify the support and resources that will be made available, which could include training, mentoring, adjustments to job duties, or approved time off to address personal matters.

**Regular Check-ins and Follow-ups**

Ensure consistent check-ins and follow-up sessions as part of the resolution process. It's likely that addressing underperformance will require multiple conversations, and it's important to allow the employee a reasonable timeframe for improvement. Schedule regular meetings, whether on a daily or weekly basis, to assess the employee's progress with the action plan and to encourage ongoing development. These meetings should offer the employee opportunities to share insights on how their work ethic is evolving and to discuss any persisting challenges.

These check-ins serve the dual purpose of holding the employee accountable for their progress and providing you with a platform to reinforce performance objectives and provide necessary training and support. Additionally, they convey your genuine commitment to helping the employee enhance their performance.

Once the employee's performance attains an acceptable level, acknowledge their achievements and engage in a discussion about how they can sustain this standard of work. 

**Recognize Progress**

When an employee is improving, it's essential to show appreciation. Tell them you've noticed their progress and praise their efforts. Be specific about what they've done well and how it's making a positive difference. This recognition helps boost their confidence and encourages them to keep getting better. It also shows that you value their strengths and believe in their ability to succeed.

It's important to offer clear and helpful feedback to an employee working on improving their performance. This feedback helps them recognize their progress and identify areas where they can still grow. Also, consider sharing feedback from colleagues who work with the employee, as their insights can shed light on how the employee's performance affects others.

**rRetain thorough documentation**

When handling an underperforming employee, just as with any employee issue, it's crucial to maintain thorough documentation. This record of the situation is a valuable resource, especially if the problem persists, and the employee questions the process. Start by keeping initial records when the issue first arises, and then diligently take detailed notes during subsequent meetings and conversations. Additionally, update the formal action plan as necessary. Following each discussion, send the employee an email summarizing what was discussed and any planned action steps. Ensure you also save any email responses or proposals from the employee. Keep a written record of the employee's progress as well.

**If the performance doesn't improve**

When one employee consistently doesn't put in effort, it can harm team spirit and the overall work environment. Allowing underperformance to persist without consequences can lead to frustration and demotivation among hardworking team members.

If the employee's performance doesn't improve despite giving them a fair chance with the action plan, it's time to consider other options. The three most common solutions are reassignment and termination.

*Reassignment:* This involves finding a different role within the organization that better aligns with the employee's skills and abilities. It's a chance for them to find a role where they can excel and contribute positively.

*Performance Improvement Plan (PIP):* This is a structured approach to help the employee improve their performance. It includes specific goals and timelines, as well as regular check-ins to monitor progress.

*Termination*: When you’ve exhausted all other options, you may have to come to the last resort of letting the employee go. While not the preferred outcome, it might be the most practical solution for everyone concerned. The process of termination is typically unpleasant and can involve complexities, so it's crucial to follow all HR procedures.

Occasionally, there could be underlying factors contributing to their performance struggles. Flexibility in assessment may be extended considering the circumstances. In such instances, the People Ops Manager can provide assistance by initiating bi-weekly meetings with the concerned manager. This arrangement allows for open discussions about any concerns regarding an individual's performance, or managers can proactively reach out to the People Ops Manager if necessary.
