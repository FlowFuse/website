## Grievance Procedure

We're all about making FlowFuse an great place to work for everyone, however if you ever run into any concerns while you're here, these guidelines are here to help you out in raising a grievance. 

This procedure applies to all employees and full-time contractors regardless of length of service. It does not apply to ad-hoc freelancers.

**Step 1: Informal Resolution**

Should an employee have a grievance, we encourage them to first attempt an informal resolution by discussing the matter with their immediate manager. This step is intended to achieve a swift and amicable resolution.

**Step 2: Submitting Grievance VIA Email**

If the employee is not satisfied with the result of the informal resolution or is hesitant to approach their immediate manager, they can escalate the matter by sending a formal grievance via email to the People Ops Manager. The email should comprehensively outline the problem, include pertinent details, and provide any available evidence that support the grievance.

**Step 3: Investigation**

Upon receipt of a formal grievance, the People Ops Manager will initiate an unbiased investigation. This might entail conversations with the concerned employee, pertinent witnesses, and a review of relevant documentation.

**Step 4: Resolution**

After the investigation, the People Ops Manager will focus on finding a fitting solution. This might include making things right, changing policies, or taking other steps to address the concern. FlowFuse aims to provide a solution within 10 days from when the employee submits their first formal grievance. Please be aware that sometimes, unforeseen circumstances can cause delays in the investigation. However, rest assured that FlowFuse is committed to resolving it as soon as possible.

**Step 5: Appeal**

If the grievance has not been resolved to your satisfaction you may appeal in writing an email to the CEO and the People Ops Manager, stating your full grounds of appeal including any additional information or arguments, within one week of the date on which the decision was sent or given to you.

**Step 6: Final Review**

We'll schedule an appeal meeting, typically within two weeks of receiving your appeal. This meeting will be conducted impartially by someone who was not previously engaged with the case. Following the appeal hearing, we'll provide our final decision, usually within one week. Unfortunately, there won't be any additional opportunity for appeal beyond this point.

**Confidentiality**

FlowFuse is firmly committed to preserving the confidentiality of all parties involved throughout the grievance process. This commitment holds while conducting a comprehensive investigation and implementing any required corrective actions.

**Non-Retaliation**

FlowFuse strictly prohibits any form of retaliation against employees who raise grievances in good faith. Any acts of retaliation will be treated as distinct violations of company policy.

This Grievance Policy is designed to ensure that employee concerns are treated fairly and promptly. FlowFuse is unwavering in its dedication to fostering an inclusive and respectful workplace and will consistently refine its policies and practices based on feedback and evolving industry standards.
