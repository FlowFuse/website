All employees at FlowFuse will find HR policies in this section of the handbook. Please note that this section of the handbook will be continuously updated to reflect the evolving needs of our organization. As FlowFuse is actively in the process of developing and incorporating additional policies, we encourage you to check back regularly for the latest updates. Your familiarity with these policies ensures that you stay informed and aligned with our company's values and practices.

## Grievance Procedure

We're all about making FlowFuse an great place to work for everyone, however if you ever run into any concerns while you're here, these guidelines are here to help you out in raising a grievance. 

This procedure applies to all employees and full-time contractors regardless of length of service. It does not apply to ad-hoc freelancers.

**Step 1: Informal Resolution**

Should an employee have a grievance, we encourage them to first attempt an informal resolution by discussing the matter with their immediate manager. If your manager is not aware or if the matter requires escalation, our People Ops Manager is available to assist. This step is intended to achieve a swift and amicable resolution.

**Step 2: Submitting Grievance via Email**

If the employee is not satisfied with the result of the informal resolution or is hesitant to approach their immediate manager, they can escalate the matter by sending a formal grievance via email to the People Ops Manager. The email should comprehensively outline the problem, include pertinent details, and provide any available evidence that support the grievance.

**Step 3: Investigation**

Upon receipt of a formal grievance, the People Ops Manager will initiate an unbiased investigation. This might entail conversations with the concerned employee, pertinent witnesses, and a review of relevant documentation.

**Step 4: Resolution**

After the investigation, the People Ops Manager will focus on finding a fitting solution. This might include making things right, changing policies, or taking other steps to address the concern. FlowFuse aims to provide a solution within 10 days from when the employee submits their first formal grievance. Please be aware that sometimes, unforeseen circumstances can cause delays in the investigation. However, rest assured that FlowFuse is committed to resolving it as soon as possible.

**Step 5: Appeal**

If the grievance has not been resolved to your satisfaction you may appeal in writing an email to the CEO and the People Ops Manager, stating your full grounds of appeal including any additional information or arguments, within one week of the date on which the decision was sent or given to you.

**Step 6: Final Review**

We'll schedule an appeal meeting, typically within two weeks of receiving your appeal. This meeting will be conducted impartially by someone who was not previously engaged with the case. Following the appeal hearing, we'll provide our final decision, usually within one week. Unfortunately, there won't be any additional opportunity for appeal beyond this point.

**Confidentiality**

FlowFuse is firmly committed to preserving the confidentiality of all parties involved throughout the grievance process. This commitment holds while conducting a comprehensive investigation and implementing any required corrective actions.

**Non-Retaliation**

FlowFuse strictly prohibits any form of retaliation against employees who raise grievances in good faith. Any acts of retaliation will be treated as distinct violations of company policy.

This Grievance Policy is designed to ensure that employee concerns are treated fairly and promptly. FlowFuse is unwavering in its dedication to fostering an inclusive and respectful workplace and will consistently refine its policies and practices based on feedback and evolving industry standards.

## Underperformance Policy

We, at FlowFuse are committed to creating an environment where both our company and employees work together to maintain high performance standards. Our goal is to support our team members and managers in achieving these standards through clear and regular communication across all aspects of our organization.

We understand that sometimes there could be underlying factors contributing to performance challenges. We are committed to being flexible in our assessment approach when considering the circumstances. In such instances, our People Ops Manager can provide valuable support by arranging bi-weekly meetings with the relevant manager. This proactive setup encourages open and transparent conversations about any performance concerns, and managers can feel free to reach out to the People Ops Manager as needed.

**Defining Underperformance**

We believe in proactively identifying indicators of potential underperformance in our employees. This approach allows us to provide timely support and intervention when needed. Here are some common signs to be aware of:

Consistently Missed Deadlines
Decline in Productivity
Increased Errors and Mistakes
Lack of Initiative
Low Engagement and Motivation
Frequent Absenteeism or Tardiness
Poor Communication
Lack of Goal Achievement
Decreased Innovation and Creativity
Isolation from Team

**Addressing Underperformance**

To promote a positive work environment, we encourage managers to address areas of improvement or specific concerns with team members during their weekly one-on-one meetings. These discussions should be documented for transparency and to clarify necessary improvements and timelines. 

Managers should also ensure employees understand expectations, provide guidance on tasks and performance standards. This clarity helps employees stay focused on their goals and contributes to a positive working atmosphere.

**Developing an Action Plan**

The action plan will include several key elements:

*Assignment of Responsibilities:* We make it clear who is responsible for what, both on the part of the employee and the employer.

*Performance Improvement Timeline:* We set a timeline for achieving the desired performance improvements, emphasizing the importance of addressing serious issues positively and outlining potential consequences.

*Support and Resources:* We outline the available support and resources, which may include training, mentoring, adjustments to job duties, or approved time off to address personal matters. Our aim is to create a supportive and constructive work environment.

**Regular Check-ins and Follow-ups**

Throughout this process, our managers will  carry out regular check-ins to support improvement, schedule regular meetings to assess progress and provide support. These meetings are an opportunity to discuss how work is evolving and address any challenges. They show our commitment to helping you succeed.

**Recognize Progress**

Once your performance reaches the desired level, we'll celebrate your achievements and discuss how to maintain this standard. Your manager will provide specific feedback about what you've done well and how it's making a positive difference.

**If the performance doesn't improve**

In case you find yourself in a situation where your performance is struggling, consider these options:

Reassignment: Explore roles within FlowFuse that align better with your skills and interests. This transition can empower you to excel and make a positive impact.

Performance Improvement Plan (PIP): Your manager will implement a structured plan aimed at supporting your performance improvement journey towards a positive step. It includes regular check-ins and specific goals.

Open Communication: If you encounter any performance-related issues, including concerns about your manager's support, feel free to reach out to the People Ops Manager. We encourage constructive candor, as listed in our values.

FlowFuse understands that team members who may not consistently meet performance expectations may thrive in a different professional environment. We fully support open and respectful discussions and decisions in this regard. It's important to highlight that close collaboration with the People Ops manager is crucial during this process.
