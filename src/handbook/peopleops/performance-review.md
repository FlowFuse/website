# Performance Review

In September a performance review is done for all employees. The performance
review is based on [our values](../company/values) and meeting role
expectations. A review is held by the direct manager of each employeee. The
manager will write down their expectations, where these were met, and where the
employee can still grow. This text is shared with each individual employee.

While this performance review is written down, each manager should be communicating
feedback regularly to minimize the chance for surprises during the written review.

## Structure

A [template document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E_Ni5kIcgRAvx9ZxFECOxJkFzzvDoUSpb5YfzKd1zCk/) is available to structure the review.
Please be sure to duplicate ***and move*** the document before filling it out as to not share employee performance reviews with others unintentionally.

The template consists of the following:

### Values

Each of the Company Values will be rated as one of the following:

- **Exceeds:** Employee consistently goes above and beyond in this area.
- **Achieves:** Employee meets expectations for their seniority in this area.
- **Room for Growth:** This is an area where the employee could improve.

Details and examples should be provided with each instance. It is also important that employees are not disheartened
if given "Room for Growth" feedback. In fact, managers are encouraged to assign this rating to at least one of the
company values, although this should not be forced.

It is almost impossible to achieve/exceed all values perfectly, sometimes particular employees are more focus on
customer/community engagement, others may be more focused on specific technical requirements. This is normal and should be embraced.

### Highlights

A chance to focus on the best things that the employee has contributed to FlowFuse since their last review (or first day
if this is their first review). Highlights should come from both employees and their managers, and are a chance to reflect
on the positive aspects of the employee's work, great contributions made and the impact it's had on the company's success.

### Compensation Changes

As per the ["Compensation"](../peopleops/compensation) section of the Handbook, FlowFuse can opt to adjust your compensation
at the same time your performance reviews are delivered. Please see the ["Adjustments"](../peopleops/compensation#adjustment)
section for more details on the factors driving those changes.

This section of the review should clearly state the Employee's existing compensation, the change (if any) to that compensation, and the net
salary after the change.

### Notes

This section should be used to capture employee thoughts, feedback, and any other topics that come up during the review.
