# Performance Review

In September a performance review is done for all employees. The performance
review is based on [our values](../company/values) and meeting role
expectations. A review is held by the direct manager of each employeee. The
manager will write down their expectations, where these were met, and where the
employee can still grow. This text is shared with each individual employee.

While this performance review is written down, each manager should be communicating
feedback regularly to minimize the chance for surprises during the written review.

The performance review process will be skipped in the following circumstances; new employees who have been with the company for less than 6 months at the time of the review cycle, employees who have been on extended leave, employees who are currently on a [Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)](/handbook/peopleops/organization/#performance-improvement-plan-(pip)),
or employees who are in the middle of role transitions or organizational changes that would make a standard review inappropriate. In cases where the formal review is skipped, managers should still provide informal feedback and check-ins to ensure ongoing communication and support.

## Structure

A [template document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E_Ni5kIcgRAvx9ZxFECOxJkFzzvDoUSpb5YfzKd1zCk/) is available to structure the review.
Please be sure to duplicate ***and move*** the document before filling it out as to not share employee performance reviews with others unintentionally.

The template consists of the following:

### Values

Each of the Company Values will be rated as one of the following:

- **Exceeds:** Employee consistently goes above and beyond in this area.
- **Achieves:** Employee meets expectations for their seniority in this area.
- **Room for Growth:** This is an area where the employee could improve.

Details and examples should be provided with each instance. It is also important that employees are not disheartened
if given "Room for Growth" feedback. In fact, managers are encouraged to assign this rating to at least one of the
company values, although this should not be forced.

It is almost impossible to achieve/exceed all values perfectly, sometimes particular employees are more focus on
customer/community engagement, others may be more focused on specific technical requirements. This is normal and should be embraced.

### Highlights

A chance to focus on the best things that the employee has contributed to FlowFuse since their last review (or first day
if this is their first review). Highlights should come from both employees and their managers, and are a chance to reflect
on the positive aspects of the employee's work, great contributions made and the impact it's had on the company's success.

### Compensation Changes

As per the ["Compensation"](../peopleops/compensation) section of the Handbook, FlowFuse can opt to adjust your compensation
at the same time your performance reviews are delivered. Please see the ["Adjustments"](../peopleops/compensation#adjustment)
section for more details on the factors driving those changes.

This section of the review should clearly state the Employee's existing compensation, the change (if any) to that compensation, and the net
salary after the change.

### Notes

This section should be used to capture employee thoughts, feedback, and any other topics that come up during the review.

## Job Band Matrix

At FlowFuse, each employee has a job band, which is a reflection of their seniority and experience. These bands come with different job descriptions, and therefore expectations at each level. For performance reviews, where we correlate each employees against their contributions with respect to the company values (as per the ["Values"](#values) section above) the following matrices can be used to help guide the review.

In each matrix, you should consider the guidance for your current band, but also be ensuring you are covering all of the items in the bands below your current position, and keeping an eye on the items in the bands above your current position for your own personal growth.

### Engineering

For Engineering roles, at each of the respective bands, the following matrix can be used to help guide the performance review:
