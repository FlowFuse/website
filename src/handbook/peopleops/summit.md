# Summit

FlowFuse intent to host a bi-annual summit bringing together all employees.
This summit aims to create an occasion where we can gather in person,
fostering connections, and facilitating collaborative discussions on a range of
subjects. 

## Structure

Summits currently last for three full days, with an additional day
allocated for pre-summit travel and another for post-summit travel. The day before
the summit, senior leadership will assemble for a strategy day.

## Location

Location might vary from summit to summit, and will be communicated three months
ahead of time, ensuring everyone has sufficient time to make their travel arrangements.
