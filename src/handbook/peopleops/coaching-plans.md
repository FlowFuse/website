# Coaching Plans

A Coaching Plan is tool for managers to aid in development of their team
members, helping them grow in their role and improve their performance through a
structured plan to be completed with the managers mentorship. Unlike
[Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs)][pip], coaching plans are proactive, focus
on growth, and come without the negative consequences of a PIP.

## Purpose and Philosophy

Coaching plans are built on the principle that all team members have potential
for growth. Either in their job skills, company value alignment, or the
operational execution of their role. Coaching plans are a positive force that
will be deployed for team members to prepare them for career advancement, job
role changes, and other changes.

## When to Use a Coaching Plan

- A team member shows potential for growth
- The growth area is specific and coachable
- The identified area for growth isn't a role deficiency, and a [PIP][pip] is in
  order
  - Minor performance areas need attention but don't warrant formal PIP
    intervention
- A team member expresses interest in expanding their responsibilities
- The team member is to be prepared for future role progression
- You observe behaviors or skills that could benefit from focused development
