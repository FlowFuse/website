# Coaching Plans

A Coaching Plan is a tool for managers to aid in development of their team
members, helping them grow in their role and improve their performance through a
structured plan to be completed with the manager's mentorship. Coaching plans can
be used both proactively for career development and when addressing performance
concerns, always with a focus on growth, support, and clear expectations. 

## Purpose and Philosophy

Coaching Plans are built on the belief that all team members have potential for growth — in their job skills, alignment with company values, or execution of their role.

Coaching Plans are a positive, intentional investment. They are used to help team members prepare for career advancement, role changes, and evolving expectations as the company grows.

## When to Use a Coaching Plan

A coaching plan should be initiated by a team member's manager when:

- A team member shows potential for growth
- The growth area is specific and coachable
- Performance issues need to be addressed with clear expectations and support
- Minor performance areas need attention and structured improvement
- A team member expresses interest in expanding their responsibilities or transitioning to a new role with additional responsibilities
- The team member is to be prepared for future role progression
- You observe behaviors or skills that could benefit from focused development

## Creating a Coaching Plan

### Identify the Opportunity

Managers should:

- Observe areas where the employee could grow or develop
- Consider the employee's career aspirations and interests
- Assess skills that would benefit from strengthening
- Identify opportunities that align with business needs
- Discuss and align with their own manager on the growth opportunity

### Develop the Coaching Plan

The coaching plan should include:

1. Development area: What skill or such is to be improved.
1. Current state: Managers' assesment of the current level.
1. Goal state: A [SMART goal][smart] goal to collectly aim for. This is the result that you're aiming for.
1. Activities: What actions, training, experience are to be done to achieve the
   set goal. This is the inputs to the goal. Team members should be active participants in trying to craft the activities. A manager's proposal in the coaching plan is just a proposal. 
1. Timeline: Start and end date, typically 30 days apart.
1. Support assets: What tools, meeting, or manager assitances will be provided
1. Update Cadence: How manager and team member align on progress, and how to
   collectively achieve goals.

## Documentation and Tracking

While coaching plans are less formal than PIPs, it's important to:

- Document the coaching plan and goals
- Track progress and development activities
- Note feedback and adjustments made
- Record achievements and milestones
- Maintain confidentiality while sharing appropriate updates with HR and
  management
  - Coaching plans are only shared with: the team member, manager, the managers'
    manager, and HR
