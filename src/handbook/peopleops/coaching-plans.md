# Coaching Plans

A Coaching Plan is a tool for managers to support the development of their team members, helping them grow in their role and improve performance through a structured plan completed with the manager’s mentorship. Coaching plans are proactive, growth-focused, and intentionally lighter-weight than a formal Performance Support Plan.

## Purpose and Philosophy

Coaching plans are built on the belief that all team members have potential for growth—whether in job skills, alignment with company values, or operational execution of their role. Coaching plans are a positive mechanism used to prepare team members for career advancement, role evolution, or to address emerging issues before they become performance concerns.

## When to Use a Coaching Plan

A coaching plan should be initiated by a team member’s manager when:

- A team member shows clear potential for growth
- The growth area is specific and coachable
- The identified area is not a core role deficiency requiring formal intervention
- Minor performance gaps need attention but do not warrant a formal Performance Support Plan
- A team member expresses interest in expanding responsibilities or transitioning into a new role
- A team member is being prepared for future role progression
- Behaviors or skills are observed that would benefit from focused development

## Coaching Plan vs. Performance Support Plan

**Coaching Plans** are:

- **Proactive** - Focused on development and growth
- **Supportive** - Emphasize mentorship and guidance
- **Opportunity-based** - Address areas for improvement before they become
  problems
- **Growth-oriented** - Aimed at expanding capabilities and preparing for
  advancement or addressing problems before they grow too big
- **Collaborative** - Employee actively participates in goal-setting

**Performance Support Plans** are:

- **Reactive** - Address existing performance deficiencies
- **Formal** - Structured process with documented consequences
- **Problem-focused** - Correct performance that falls below standards
- **Corrective** - Aimed at bringing performance up to acceptable levels
- **Prescriptive** - Clear expectations with defined outcomes

## Creating a Coaching Plan

### Identify the Opportunity

Managers should:

- Observe areas where the employee could grow or develop
- Consider the employee's career aspirations and interests
- Assess skills that would benefit from strengthening
- Identify opportunities that align with business needs
- Discuss and align with their own manager on the growth opportunity

### Develop the Coaching Plan

The coaching plan should include:

1. Development area: What skill or such is to be improved.
1. Current state: Managers' assesment of the current level.
1. Goal state: A [SMART goal][smart] goal to collectly aim for. This is the result that you're aiming for.
1. Activities: What actions, training, experience are to be done to achieve the
   set goal. This is the inputs to the goal. Team members should be active participants in trying to craft the activities. A manager's proposal in the coaching plan is just a proposal. 
1. Timeline: Start and end date, typically 30 days apart.
1. Support assets: What tools, meeting, or manager assitances will be provided
1. Update Cadence: How manager and team member align on progress, and how to
   collectively achieve goals.

## Documentation and Tracking

While coaching plans are less formal than Performance Support Plans, it is still important to:

- Document the coaching plan and goals
- Track progress and development activities
- Note feedback and adjustments made
- Record achievements and milestones
- Maintain confidentiality while sharing appropriate updates with HR and
  management
  - Coaching plans are only shared with: the team member, manager, the managers'
    manager, and HR
