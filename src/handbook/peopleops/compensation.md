# Compensation

FlowFuse provides a comprehensive compensation package with base salary, augmented
depending on the role with stock options (equity), and/or performance bonus structure.
FlowFuse aims to be competitive with similar companies. Factors like
company stage, market conditions, role, and level influence salary
determination during the hiring process. FlowFuse typically pays in the local
currency, unless there are explicit discussions stating otherwise, taking
into account location and company context.

## Compensation Increase Cycle

FlowFuse follows a single-point increase cycle for salary adjustments. These
adjustments take place once a year, aligning with the company's budgeting
and planning process. When determining compensation changes, FlowFuse considers
three factors: performance, inflation, and market standards. These factors are
taken into account together to make decisions about adjusting employee compensation.

For sales functions, these conversations are held once a year with each individual.
These conversations include quota negotiation, base and performance compensation.
The [compensation plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gAf6DuFnd20Ny_Ere5WnB6u63feB1lEE/view) is
accompanied by an [exhibit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kYxnzVR0lh0GIZ1FHsPjq3QvggxN0hiVGLgwZMMKHo0/edit).
When the terms of the next years compensation plan are signed they should be put
into this [private Google Drive directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yVryN4Kir7n8TLbM_cEttXb_rDC2ORn2) by managment.

## Sales Commissions

FlowFuse pays out commissions to sales reps, the terms of which are to be found
in [this template doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KSf0N5H6vzUPJrpIqQGffgHk-_5OK2HeS-fuRHTSYw).

### Sales Compensation Structure

FlowFuse follows a balanced sales compensation model:
- **Base/Commission Split**: 50/50 split between base salary and commission opportunity
- **OTE Target**: FlowFuse targets a 5x OTE (On-Target Earnings) multiple for sales roles
- **Commission Basis**: Commission is calculated based on booked new Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)

This structure ensures competitive compensation while aligning sales performance with company growth objectives.

## Performance Review

Performance reviews will be carried out annually, in September. Any employee or
contractor who has completed more than six months of service at FlowFuse is eligible
to participate in the performance review process.

### Adjustment

FlowFuse can choose to increase compensation based on varying situations:
- Past year performance, as evaluated during the September performance review.
- Market positioning, aiming to align compensation within the 50-75th percentile range for companies at the same stage.

### Equity

FlowFuse intends to offers equity for key roles. The level of stock compensation
can vary based on when an employee joined, their performance, and the variables
that decide salary. Equity is offered as stock options, which upon
execution will be transformed in the underlying stock. Stock compensation is
awarded on a 4 year vesting schedule with a 1 year cliff.

Employees might be taxed personally when accepting or executing stock options.
FlowFuse does not provide any advice on financial decisions for employees. For
details on the Stock Options like the 409A valuation or otherwise, please consult
Carta.

FlowFuse offers employees ISOs to US full time employees. Contractors and other
forms of employments for US personel will receive NSOs. Non-US employees will
also receive NSOs.

Equity grants are subject to board approval. Grants are presented to the Board
four times per year at official Board Meetings. 

### Benefits

The final component of our total compensation is the benefits package. While our intention is to keep these benefits as location independent as possible and practical, we also strive to provide all employees with a decent standard of living. Therefore, in certain cases, we may offer location-dependent benefits to ensure that appropriate standards are met. 

Please note that the benefits offered may be subject to change during your employment. These changes may occur due to evolving legislation, fluctuations in the costs associated with providing the benefits, situations where the costs outweigh the benefits for team members, or other relevant reasons. We aim to ensure that any adjustments made to the benefits package are made with careful consideration and the best interests of our employees in mind.
