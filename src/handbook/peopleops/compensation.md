# Compensation

FlowFuse provides a comprehensive compensation package with base salary, augmented
depending on the role with stock options (equity), and/or performance bonus structure.
FlowFuse aims to be competitive with similar companies. Factors like
company stage, market conditions, role, and level influence salary
determination during the hiring process. FlowFuse typically pays in the local
currency, unless there are explicit discussions stating otherwise, taking
into account location and company context.

## Pay Frequency

FlowFuse uses different pay schedules depending on the employee's region. This ensures payroll, taxation, and benefits deductions follow local standards.

### United States
Employees in the United States are paid **semi-monthly**, meaning **twice per month** for a total of **24 pay periods per year**.

### Europe
Employees in Europe are paid **monthly**, on a schedule aligned with local payroll requirements.

### Canada
Pay frequency for Canadian employees is managed through Deel and may vary depending on provincial requirements. Team members in Canada should refer to Deel for the most current information.

All payroll deductions—including taxes, retirement contributions, and voluntary benefit premiums—are taken according to the employee’s regional pay schedule.

## Compensation Increase Cycle

FlowFuse follows a single-point increase cycle for salary adjustments. These
adjustments take place once a year, aligning with the company's budgeting
and planning process. When determining compensation changes, FlowFuse considers
three factors: performance, inflation, and market standards. These factors are
taken into account together to make decisions about adjusting employee compensation.

For sales functions, these conversations are held once a year with each individual.
These conversations include quota negotiation, base and performance compensation.
The [compensation plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gAf6DuFnd20Ny_Ere5WnB6u63feB1lEE/view) is
accompanied by an [exhibit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kYxnzVR0lh0GIZ1FHsPjq3QvggxN0hiVGLgwZMMKHo0/edit).
When the terms of the next years compensation plan are signed they should be put
into this [private Google Drive directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yVryN4Kir7n8TLbM_cEttXb_rDC2ORn2) by managment.

## Sales Commissions

FlowFuse pays out commissions to sales reps, the terms of which are to be found
in [this template doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KSf0N5H6vzUPJrpIqQGffgHk-_5OK2HeS-fuRHTSYw).

### Sales Compensation Structure

FlowFuse follows a balanced sales compensation model:
- **Base/Commission Split**: 50/50 split between base salary and commission opportunity
- **OTE Target**: FlowFuse targets a 5x OTE (On-Target Earnings) multiple for sales roles
- **Commission Basis**: Commission is calculated based on booked new Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)

This structure ensures competitive compensation while aligning sales performance with company growth objectives.

## Performance Review

Performance reviews will be carried out annually, in September. Any employee or
contractor who has completed more than six months of service at FlowFuse is eligible
to participate in the performance review process.

### Adjustment

FlowFuse can choose to increase compensation based on varying situations:
- Past year performance, as evaluated during the September performance review.
- Market positioning, aiming to align compensation within the 50-75th percentile range for companies at the same stage.

### Equity

FlowFuse intends to offers equity for key roles. The level of stock compensation
can vary based on when an employee joined, their performance, and the variables
that decide salary. Equity is offered as stock options, which upon
execution will be transformed in the underlying stock. Stock compensation is
awarded on a 5-year monthly vesting schedule with a 1 year cliff.

Employees might be taxed personally when accepting or executing stock options.
FlowFuse does not provide any advice on financial decisions for employees. For
details on the Stock Options like the 409A valuation or otherwise, please consult
Carta.

FlowFuse offers ISOs to US employees. Contractors and other forms of employment
for US personnel will receive NSOs. Non-US employees will also receive NSOs.

Equity grants are subject to board approval. Grants are presented to the Board
four times per year at official Board Meetings. 

### Benefits

The final component of our total compensation is the benefits package. While our intention is to keep these benefits as location independent as possible and practical, we also strive to provide all employees with a decent standard of living. Therefore, in certain cases, we may offer location-dependent benefits to ensure that appropriate standards are met. 

Please note that the benefits offered may be subject to change during your employment. These changes may occur due to evolving legislation, fluctuations in the costs associated with providing the benefits, situations where the costs outweigh the benefits for team members, or other relevant reasons. We aim to ensure that any adjustments made to the benefits package are made with careful consideration and the best interests of our employees in mind.

# Bonus Processing
FlowFuse compensates some employees through bonuses tied to role-specific goals, quarterly MBOs, or company performance. Bonus eligibility and maximum amounts are defined in the employee’s contract. This guide outlines how bonuses are tracked, reviewed, approved, and paid.

## Bonus Tracking
All active bonuses must be listed in the [Employee Bonus Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VI3iaqkOtLGYKJ_dNshjjyYJPCxDg3pnNJT46X1URFI/edit?usp=sharing) (🔒 access only for BizzOps team members).

Each manager is responsible for ensuring the BizzOps team is informed timely, before the start of a quarter, what bonus triggers and MBOs are in play, clear, measurable, and time-bound. Explicit approval from the CEO is required for each bonus structure.

## Quarterly & Period-Based Bonuses (MBOs)
For bonuses tied to quarterly or period-based MBOs:
* MBOs must be defined at the start of the period.
* MBOs must be communicated in writing (email is sufficient) between:
* The manager
* The employee
* The CEO (cc)

Bonuses will not be processed if MBOs are defined or changed after the period has started.

## Bonus Review (End of Period)
* Within 5 business days after period end, the employee sends a final MBO summary to the Manager covering:
  * Bonus period (quarter or dates)
  * Agreed MBO goals
  * Results achieved per goal
  * Completion status
  * Supporting artifacts or links
* The Manager sends reminders at period end and 2 business days before the deadline, if needed.
* The Manager reviews the submission and confirms:
  * Thresholds met
  * Attainment percentage (if applicable)
  * Final bonus amount for CEO approval

## CEO Confirmation
Before any bonus is processed, the manager must email the CEO confirming:
* Employee name
* Performance period
* Results achieved
* Final bonus amount

Only results achieved within the defined period are considered, even if reporting is finalized later.

## Processing the Bonus Payment
Once approved in writing by the CEO:
* Process the bonus in Deel:
  * Contractors: add as Bonuses and Incentives
  * EOR employees: add under Payments and Submissions

* Clearly label the payment as a Bonus, including:
  * Performance period (e.g. “Q4 2025”)
  * Reason for payment (e.g. “Quarterly MBO attainment”)

Bonuses are paid in the next payroll cycle after approval.
