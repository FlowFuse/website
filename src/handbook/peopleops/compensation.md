# Compensation

Total compensation consists of 3 elements, salary, equity, and benefits.
FlowForge aims to provide a total compensation package on par with similar
companies in terms of: stage of the company, market, role, and level in the role.
The data to validate our compensation is obtained through OptionImpact/Pave.com.

## Salary

Salary for each role is determined initially during the hiring process based
on compensation expectation of the candidate as well as the market rates. Salary
is based on your location you live in and the company context. FlowForge pays in
your local currency unless explicitly discussed otherwise.

## Transition to Single-Point Increase Cycle and Inflation Correction

We are making some changes to how we handle salary increases at FlowForge. We're moving away from the current two-point increase cycle and adopting a single-point increase cycle. This will make the process more streamlined and predictable for everyone. Along with this change, we will also be incorporating inflation correction for applicable countries. 

With the single-point increase cycle, salary adjustments will happen once a year, aligning with our annual budgeting and planning process. This will provide a clear timeline for adjustments.

In applicable countries, we will be adjusting salaries to account for inflation rates. This ensures that employees' purchasing power is maintained. The adjustment percentage will be based on reliable inflation data from trusted sources. 

The performance evaluation process will remain consistent, focusing on goal achievement, feedback, and professional development. Managers will consider the inflation correction during salary adjustment discussions in applicable countries. FlowForge will closely monitor the effectiveness and fairness of the single-point increase cycle and inflation correction. If necessary, we will make adjustments to align with our goals and market conditions. 

It's important to note that performance appraisal evaluations and inflation corrections will continue to be handled separately to ensure fairness. Each aspect will receive the necessary attention for equitable compensation decisions. By implementing these changes, we aim to improve operational efficiency, support goal achievement, and ensure fair compensation practices. 

It is important to note that we will always consider current market standards and factors such as inflation, reviews, and market standards when determining your increase.

# Performance Review

Performance reviews will be carried out annually, with the specific timeframe set for September. Employees will receive prior notification to ensure they have ample time to prepare and stay informed. Employees will be given advance notice of the exact timeframe, allowing them to adequately prepare and stay well-informed. Any employee or contractor who has completed more than six months of service at FlowForge is eligible to participate in the performance review process. that any employee or contractor who has completed at least six months of service at FlowForge is eligible for a performance review.

### Adjustment

FlowForge can choose to increase compensation based on varying situations:
- Past year performance, as documented in the September performance review
- To stay between the 50-75th percentile for companies our stage
- As part of the performance review process, we will also consider salary adjustments. If you're eligible, you may get a raise based on how well you performed in the evaluation.


## Equity

FlowForge intents to offers equity for most roles. The level of stock compensation
can vary based on when an employee joined, their performance, and the variables
that decide salary. Equity is offered as stock options, which upon
execution will be transformed in the underlying stock. Stock compensation are
awarded on a 4 year vesting schedule with a 1 year cliff.

Employees might be taxed personally when accepting or executing stock options.
FlowForge does not provide any advice on financial decisions for employees. For
FlowForge employees the Fair Market Value of the underlying stock can be found
in [this internal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_DmqzQ5rmjYHlBvF5owJpj3JVR_BlJUg_S-pwfRtA5g).

Equity is subject to board approval.

## Benefits

The final component of our total compensation is the benefits package. While our intention is to keep these benefits as location independent as possible and practical, we also strive to provide all employees with a decent standard of living. Therefore, in certain cases, we may offer location-dependent benefits to ensure that appropriate standards are met. 

Please note that the benefits offered may be subject to change during your employment. These changes may occur due to evolving legislation, fluctuations in the costs associated with providing the benefits, situations where the costs outweigh the benefits for team members, or other relevant reasons. We aim to ensure that any adjustments made to the benefits package are made with careful consideration and the best interests of our employees in mind.
