# Compensation

Total compensation consists of 3 elements, salary, equity, and benefits.
FlowForge aims to provide a total compensation package on par with similar
companies in terms of: stage of the company, market, role, and level in the role.
The data to validate our compensation is obtained through OptionImpact/Pave.com.

## Salary

Salary for each role is determined initially during the hiring process based
on compensation expectation of the candidate as well as the market rates. Salary
is based on your location you live in and the company context. FlowForge pays in
your local currency unless explicitly discussed otherwise.

### Adjustment

FlowForge can choose to increase compensation based on varying situations:
- Past year performance, as documented in the September performance review
- To stay between the 50-75th percentile for companies our stage

## Equity

FlowForge intents to offers equity for most roles. The level of stock compensation
can vary based on when an employee joined, their performance, and the variables
that decide salary. Equity is offered as stock options, which upon
execution will be transformed in the underlying stock. Stock compensation are
awarded on a 4 year vesting schedule with a 1 year cliff.

Employees might be taxed personally when accepting or executing stock options.
FlowForge does not provide any advice on financial decisions for employees. For
FlowForge employees the Fair Market Value of the underlying stock can be found
in [this internal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_DmqzQ5rmjYHlBvF5owJpj3JVR_BlJUg_S-pwfRtA5g).

Equity is subject to board approval.

## Benefits

Last component of the total compensation are the benefits offered. The intent is
to keep these as location independent as possible and practical. However, as a
company we strive to offer everyone a decent standard of living. As such we might
offer location dependant benefits to ensure standards are met.

Benefits might change during your employment based on changing legislation,
changing costs to offer said benefits, or costs outweighing the benefits for team
members, or other reasons.
