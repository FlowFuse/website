# US Immigration

FlowFuse may ask team members to relocate to the United States when it is in
the best interest of the company. When the board decides that a team member
should move to the US, FlowFuse will fully sponsor and pay for the visa process.

## Visa Sponsorship

FlowFuse will cover all costs associated with obtaining a US work visa. This
includes legal fees, filing fees, and any other expenses related to the
immigration process. The company will work with immigration attorneys to ensure
the process is handled correctly and efficiently.

Your visa application will be sponsored by FlowFuse Inc. The company will manage
the petition process and keep you informed throughout. If your visa requires
renewal or adjustment of status, FlowFuse will continue to sponsor and cover
those costs as well.

## Relocation Support

FlowFuse partners with [Relocity](https://www.relocity.com/){rel="nofollow"} to
support team members relocating to the US. Relocity provides hands-on assistance
both before and after your move, including:

- Destination guidance and neighborhood recommendations
- Housing search and temporary accommodation
- Setting up essentials (bank accounts, phone plans, utilities)
- On-the-ground support once you arrive in the US
- Ongoing settling-in assistance for you and your family

Relocity ensures you have a dedicated point of contact to help navigate the
practical side of moving to a new country, so you can focus on your work at
FlowFuse.

## What FlowFuse Does Not Use

FlowFuse does not use Deel for US immigration or relocation services. While Deel
is used for other aspects of employment administration, the immigration and
relocation experience through Deel does not meet the standard we want for our
team members making such a significant life change.
