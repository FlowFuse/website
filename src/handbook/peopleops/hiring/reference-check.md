navTitle: Reference Check
---

Reference checks are a late-stage input in the hiring process, conducted after the interview stages but before extending an offer. These conversations are primarily used to validate interview signals and provide context to support onboarding and early management.

## When to Conduct Reference Checks

Reference checks should be conducted after all interviews are complete and the hiring team has identified a preferred candidate. We typically request three professional references from the candidate, preferably including:
- A former direct manager
- A peer or colleague
- A direct report (if applicable for the role)

We request references to ensure a range of perspectives. In cases where providing three references is not feasible (for example, candidates who are currently employed or early in their career), the hiring team may proceed with fewer references and treat this as contextual information rather than a blocker.

We do not expect candidates to provide references from their current employer unless they explicitly offer to do so.

## Structure of a Reference Check Call

The reference check is typically a 20–30 minute conversation conducted over the phone or video call. Live conversations are preferred over async forms to allow for nuance, follow-up questions, and contextual understanding. The flow should be:

1. Introduce yourself and FlowFuse, and explain the purpose of the call.
2. Confirm the reference's relationship to the candidate and time worked together.
3. Ask the [reference check questions](#reference-check-questions).
4. Thank the reference for their time and insights.

## Reference Check Questions

These questions are intended to surface working style, strengths, and growth areas to support onboarding and early management. When speaking with peers or colleagues, ask for concrete examples and specific situations rather than general impressions.

During the reference check, aim to understand:

1. Can you describe how you worked with [Candidate Name] and how long you worked together?
2. What is one trait or quality that stands out most to you?
3. How does [Candidate Name] typically prefer to work day to day?
   - For example, do they tend to do best in highly autonomous environments, or in more collaborative team settings?
4. Compared to others you’ve worked with in similar roles, how does [Candidate Name] stand out?
5. What would you want [Candidate Name]’s new manager or team to know to help them be successful?
6. (Optional) Is there anyone else you think might be helpful for us to speak with if we want additional context?

Backdoor or informal references are optional and should be used sparingly. They should never involve a candidate’s current employer and should be treated as directional context rather than definitive signal.

## Making the Decision

Reference checks should confirm what you learned during the interview process.
Discrepancies between interview impressions and reference feedback warrant
further investigation, also when the feedback was positive but diverges from what was expected.

Positive reference checks that align with interview performance give confidence to proceed with an offer.

Reference checks are not intended to independently veto a hire. When feedback materially contradicts interview signals, the hiring team should pause, investigate further, and align on next steps before making a final decision.

Insights from reference checks should be carried into onboarding conversations and early manager check-ins to support the candidate’s success.
