navTitle: Reference Check
---

Reference checks are a late-stage input in the hiring process, conducted after the interview stages but before extending an offer. These conversations are primarily used to validate interview signals and provide context to support onboarding and early management.

## When to Conduct Reference Checks

Reference checks should be conducted after all interviews are complete and the hiring team has identified a preferred candidate. We typically request three professional references from the candidate, preferably including:
- A former direct manager
- A peer or colleague
- A direct report (if applicable for the role)

FlowFuse will conduct 1 or 2 reference check calls, typically prioritizing
conversations with former managers who can speak to the candidate's performance.

## Structure of a Reference Check Call

The reference check is typically a 20-30 minute conversation conducted over the phone or video call. The structure should be:

1. Introduce yourself and FlowFuse, and explain the purpose of the call.
2. Confirm the reference's relationship to the candidate and time worked together.
3. Ask the [reference check questions](#reference-check-questions).
4. Thank the reference for their time and insights.

## Reference Check Questions

During the reference check, aim to understand:

1. Their working relationship; In what capacity did they collaborate? How long did you work together, and in what time period?
1. What's their one trait you remember really well?
1. How does the candidate prefer to work?
   - Does this person work best in fully autonomous settings, or as part of a team?
1. How would you place this person compared to everyone you've worked with? (top 0.1%, 1%, 10%, ...)
1. What should the candidate's new manager / team know to help them be successful in their next role?
1. Who else should the company speak with (if you're looking to run backdoor references).
1. If they were managing the candidate again, what would you focus on developing?
1. Would they hire the candidate again if you had the opportunity? Why or why not?


## Making the Decision

Reference checks should confirm what you learned during the interview process.
Discrepancies between interview impressions and reference feedback warrant
further investigation, also when the feedback was positive but diverges from what was expected.

Positive reference checks that align with interview performance give confidence
to proceed with an offer. If significant concerns arise during reference checks,
discuss them with the hiring team before making a final decision.
