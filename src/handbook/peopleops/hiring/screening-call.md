navTitle: Screening Call
---

The first stage in almost every interview process is a 15-20 minute screening call. 
This is usually done over a video call, but a phone call can be acceptable in certain circumstances. 

#### Screening Call

This screening call serves as a filter for both the company to align with the candidate on mutual expectations and the details of the role. 

During this call FlowFuse should understand:
1. Alignment to [Values](../../company/values.md)
1. The candidate is enthusiastic about the company and the open role
1. Compensation range for the candidate
1. The candidate's time zone and any overlap information that is needed
1. Notice period, or time from offer to start

Generally half of all candidates in the screening stage will not move to the next stage of the interview process.
