# Working with Recruiters

FlowFuse works with external recruiters to help identify and attract qualified
candidates for open positions. The way the company works with recruiters is
this way to have transparency, pay the recruiter and candidate (when hired), and
keep the hiring process aligned with our values.

## Non-Exclusive Recruitment

FlowFuse does not grant exclusive recruitment rights to any single recruiter.
When we open a role:

* The position is posted publicly and remains accessible to all candidates
* Multiple recruiters may work on the same job posting simultaneously
* Candidates can apply directly or be referred by any recruiter
* All recruiters have equal opportunity to submit qualified candidates
* Candidates are assigned to recruiters or inbound channels at the time they _first_ apply

## Recruiter Compensation

Recruiters are compensated with a fixed rate based on the average candidate's
first-year base compensation package. The target compensation range for each
role is established before recruiters begin submitting candidates. This
structure:

* Provides predictable costs for FlowFuse
* Eliminates potential conflicts of interest during salary negotiations
* Ensures recruiters focus on finding the right fit, anywhere in the world
