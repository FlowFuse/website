# Holiday and Leave

## Logging time off

When taking more than 3 days off consecutively, tell (don't ask) your manager.
This ensures scheduling of work and operations can continue to run smoothly
without you. When taking more than 2 consecutive weeks off, seek approval from
your manager.

Before you can take time off you should _always_:

- Log your time off
  [in Deel](https://help.letsdeel.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4409044013201-How-do-I-request-time-off-)
  - Deel disallows [overages on the contracted days off](#holiday-policy). If
    you cannot file the complete length, file up to the allowance.
    - This is a limitation in Deel and does not limit the amount of time off you may take.
- Add an 'Out of Office' appointment in your personal Google Calendar, and
  decline all meetings automatically.
- Add your Out of Office to your [team calendar](#team-calendars) as `Name OOO`.
- Add a 'Vacation responder' to your Gmail account, and provide another contact
  person within your team.
  1. Open **Gmail** in your browser.
  2. Click the **gear icon (⚙️)** in the top-right corner, then choose **“See
     all settings.”**
  3. Scroll down to the **“Vacation responder”** section in the **General** tab.
  4. Set:
     - **First day** and **Last day**
     - **Subject** (e.g., _"Out of Office"_)
     - **Message** (e.g., _"I am out of the office and without email access
       through [Day], [Date]. Please contact [team member] in my absence."_)
- Inform fellow team members of your time off, and hand over work that’s distributed.
  
### Team Calendars

We use team-specific calendars to track team meetings, events, and team-level availability.

Out of Office time should be visible in two places:
- Your **personal calendar** so collaborators across the company can see your availability.
- Your **team calendar** so your immediate team has clear visibility into coverage and capacity.

This is intentional and not considered duplication. Each calendar serves a different audience.

If you own a recurring event, place it on the most appropriate calendar for visibility. In some cases, this may still be the FlowFuse Team Events calendar.

## Holiday Policy

FlowFuse has an unlimited time off policy. Taking vacation is encouraged for all
team members. To prevent an undefined number of vacation days to start a race to
the bottom, we recommend each team member to take a minimum of 25 days a year,
and at least 5 days a quarter.

Due to legal limitations, Canadian employees can not be offered unlimited PTO
and will have the aforementioned 25 days instead.

## Sick leave

Sick leave, or having limited availability, is not recorded currently. Keep your
manager updated on your health, and let them know what FlowFuse can do for you
to aid in your recovery.

Please log the days you're out in the team calendar so the rest of the company
understands you're unavailable.

## Parental Leave

If you live in a country where a statutory Parental Leave benefit is available,
you will be required to claim statutory Parental Leave pay (if you are
eligible).

Any employee can take up to 6 weeks if they wish without requiring manager
approval. We recommend a minimum of 4 weeks, but recognize it's a personal
choice to make. Further leave can be requested, but should be discussed with
your manager. Inform your manager of the expected new family member at least 16
weeks before the due date to qualify for the extended parental leave.

If you live in a country that offers statutory leave longer than this, then
FlowFuse will abide by this.

## Bereavement Leave

Our company understands the profound impact that the loss of a loved one can
have on an employee, and we are committed to supporting our team members during
difficult times. Therefore, FlowFuse has a bereavement leave policy. Employees
who experience the death of an immediate family member, such as a spouse, child,
parent, or sibling, are eligible for up to five consecutive days of paid leave.
