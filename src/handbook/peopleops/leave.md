# Holiday and Leave

## Logging time off

When taking more than 3 days off consecutively, tell (don't ask) your manager.
This ensure scheduling of work and operations continue to run smoothly without
you. When taking over 2 weeks of consecutively seek approval from your manager.

Before you can take time off you should _always_:

- Log your time off
  [in Deel](https://help.letsdeel.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4409044013201-How-do-I-request-time-off-)
  - Deel disallows [overages on the contracted days off](#holiday-policy), if
    you cannot file the complete length, file up to the allowance.
- Add an 'Out of office' appointment in your personal Google Calendar, and
  decline all meetings automatically.
- Add a 'Vacation responder' to your Gmail account, and provide another contact
  person within your team.
  1. Open **Gmail** in your browser.
  2. Click the **gear icon (⚙️)** in the top-right corner, then choose **“See
     all settings.”**
  3. Scroll down to the **“Vacation responder”** section in the **General** tab.
  4. Set:
     - **First day** and **Last day**
     - **Subject** (e.g., _"Out of Office"_)
     - **Message** (e.g., _"I am out of the office and without email access
       through [Day], [Date]. Please contact [team member] in my absence."_)
- Add an event to the shared 'FlowFuse Team Events' calendar showing all the
  days you will not be working. This makes it easier for our team to understand
  who is going to be away each week.
- Inform fellow team members of your time off, and hand over work that's
  distributed.

PTO requests in Deel will be routed to your manager.

## Holiday Policy

FlowFuse has a unlimited time off policy. Taking vacation is encouraged for all
team members. To prevent an undefined number of vacation days to start a race to
the bottom, we recommend each team member to take a minimum of 25 days a year,
and at least 5 days a quarter.

Due to legal limitations, Canadian employees can not be offered unlimited PTO
and will have the aforementioned 25 days instead.

## Sick leave

Sick leave, or having limited availability, is not recorded currently. Keep your
manager updated on your health, and let them know what FlowFuse can do for you
to aid in your recovery.

Please log the days you're out in the team calendar so the rest of the company
understands you're unavailable.

## Parental Leave

If you live in a country where a statutory Parental Leave benefit is available,
you will be required to claim statutory Parental Leave pay (if you are
eligible).

Any employee can take up to 6-weeks if they wish without requiring manager
approval. We recommend a minimum of 4 weeks, but recognize it's a personal
choice to make. Further leave can be requested, but should be discussed with
your manager. Inform your manager of the expected new family member at least 16
weeks before the due date to qualify for the extended parental leave.

If you live in a country that offers statutory leave longer than this, then
FlowFuse will abide by this.

## Bereavement Leave

Our company understands the profound impact that the loss of a loved one can
have on an employee, and we are committed to supporting our team members during
difficult times. Therefore, FlowFuse has a bereavement leave policy. Employees
who experience the death of an immediate family member, such as a spouse, child,
parent, or sibling, are eligible for up to five consecutive days of paid leave.
