FlowForge will host a biannual summit, occurring twice a year, bringing together all employees. This summit aims to create an occasion where we can gather in person, fostering connections, and facilitating collaborative discussions on a range of subjects. The summits will last for three full days, with an additional day allocated for pre-summit travel and another for post-summit travel. Before the summit, senior leadership will assemble for a strategy day. Location information for the summit will be communicated three months ahead of time, ensuring everyone has sufficient time to make their travel arrangements.
