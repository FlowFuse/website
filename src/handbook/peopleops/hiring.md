# Hiring

## Interviews

When a candidate applied they'll have at least two interviews with two different
interviewers before an offer is extended to them. One interview will investigate
the [fit on values](../company/values). The second will be a competency based
interview.

When interviewing to hire new team members, optimize for value-fit over
culture-fit. Hiring for value-fit allows others to add to culture and thus fosters
diversity and inclusivity.

### STAR interviews

Using [the STAR framework](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method)
candidates will be interviewed to describe their experiences in the past.
Through their actions we hope to be able to predict their performance in the
future.

For the interviewer a template is available with the [STAR questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v6C1Tf6B-hDOlA9GhR44Y2ftDgiwx4x_twnuo_N4pZE){rel="nofollow"}
to make a copy of.

## Extending an offer

When a candidate goes through the full hiring process an offer might be extended
to them. At such a time it's good to understand that the offer at that time is
conditional on background checks. If the offer includes an equity component,
this part is conditional on board approval of such a grant. Be sure to be
explicit about these conditions.

Please use [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rY0gLLpkOPBVGlMy7PVhnVjmRF53MhkeDET4TkfPJIs){rel="nofollow"} to stage an email.

## After an offer is accepted

Onboarding on our EOR provider, Deel, takes at least 3 to 4 weeks. The start
date for a new employee should be at least 3 to 4 weeks out. When a
[conditional offer](#extending-an-offer) has been accepted you should immediately:

1. [Create an onboarding issue](https://github.com/flowforge/admin/issues/new/choose){rel="nofollow"} on the admin GitHub project
1. Update the [internal team overview spreadsheet](./organization#internal-team-overview)
1. Add their stock options to the stock option request spreadsheets
   * Copy or create a new monthly request sheet from [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AG75qONjObto3g2oJH_SC4gjgRsYJmKUI3fjrZuktm0/edit#gid=1970623412){rel="nofollow"}

### Tax Residency
During the onboarding process on our EOR provider platform, candidates must either be citizens of the country where they will be working or possess a valid visa. Any requests for changes in tax residency should be communicated to the HR department and CEO at least 2 months in advance.

## Onboarding

Just before your first day of work at FlowForge, you will receive an email requesting your GitHub username and preferred company email address. An issue
will be created on our [internal issue tracker][issue-tracker] with steps for you and
the team to complete once you start.

On the day you start, a message will be sent to your personal email address to grant you access to your FlowForge email address.

After setting up your password, you must [turn on the 2-Step Verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop). Otherwise, after a few days, you will be locked out of your account and will need an admin's help to log back in.

Once your FlowForge email is set up, you will have access to invitations to other services and platforms, including 1Password. [Set this up](https://support.1password.com/explore/team-member/) as soon as possible to add a security layer to all your FlowForge accounts.

On your first day, after your email and 1Password accounts are set up, you should prioritize gaining access to Slack, the FlowForge GitHub organization, and completing your onboarding issue. Your manager will also assign work for you to start on in the first week.

## Greenhouse

### Opening a Job

When opening a job post, you'll need a couple of things:
1. A draft Job Description
1. Approved role availability
1. Support for a PeopleOps Manager to setup the role in Greenhouse

Once these are in place a pipeline needs to be designeed by the PeopleOps manager.

### Pipeline design

A pipeline needs to be designed, meaning; you'll need to define all stages of the hiring process.

#### Accepting applications

Applicants for a job must provide their resume. Optionally a cover letter could
be supplied. Furthermore, it's recommended to include one or two acceptance
questions to filter applicants. These questions should be related to the position
being opened. For example; for a developer you might ask what happens if someone
types `https://flowforge.com` in their browser, after they press enter. Aim to
be thought provoking with the question, though the answer shouldn't take over
a minute or two to think of and type for a skilled candidate.

#### Initial Review

The initial review will check the aforementioned question for validity, the resume, and the cover letter.
Check for:
1. Alignment to [Values](../company/values.md)
1. Capabilities align with the requirements for the role
1. Previous retention at companies
   - We'd like people to join the company for the long term, if their previous roles suggest the candidate will not join for the long term please reject them

For each candidate we'd like to move forward with, a scorecard needs to be filled
out based on the available information so the interviewer for the next stage can
prepare and focus if the strengths are indeed strong, and the same for weaknesses or uncertainties.

The resume review should reject **over 50%** of all candidates.

#### Screening Call

The initial screening call is intended as an additional filter for FlowForge, but also for the candidate. Screening calls are held on a video call, and the candidate should have plenty of time to ask question and understand if this role is right for them.
During this call FlowForge should understand:
1. Alignment to [Values](../company/values.md)
1. The candidate is enthusiastic about the company and the open role
1. Compensation range for the candidate
1. Notice period, or time from offer to start

For all candidates that are moved on the next stage a scorecard needs to be filled out.

After this stage **no more than 25%** of the total number of candidates should remain.

#### Skills assessment

For each role a skills assessment will be performed. This stage will be different for most roles. This is the main stage to asses the capabilities.

This round will again result in a scorecard, but also an indication what level this candidate would suit in.
For example `intermediate` vs `senior` for developers.

When in doubt, reject the candidate.

#### STAR interview
After the skills assessment, the last round includes a behaviour interview. STAR interviews are aimed at discussing the candidates past performance in certain situations, and hopefully predict the way they acted is in line with FlowForge expectations.

Again, a scoresheet will be filled out.

#### Offer stage

First, read about [extending offers](#extending-an-offer).

At the offer stage all scorecards will be re-evaluated to understand what the candidate strengths and challenges are.
Before the peopleops team extends an offer, explicit approval is required from:
1. A peopleops manager
   - Check we hire in their location
   - Notice period aligns with internal processes
   - Total compensation is in FlowForge's range
1. The new manager of the candidate
1. CEO

When a candidate accepted an offer, proceed to [onboard them](#after-an-offer-is-accepted).

### Closing a job

As soon as there's a pipeline that would support at least three strong candidates
for the open position, take the job posting offline. Candidates applying for a job
that's no longer available is a waste of their time and a bad experience with
FlowForge and hurts our reputation.

## Offboarding
The purpose of the offboarding section in the handbook is to provide a clear and structured framework for employees at FlowForge to follow during the offboarding process. The offboarding process is managed by the People Ops Manager in close collaboration with the CEO, Reporting Managers, and Deel for Payroll at FlowForge.

When a team member or contractor decides to leave FlowForge, they will receive a detailed email before their final date of employment. The email will include information regarding the impact on benefits coverage, stocks, final pay, and the process for returning any company assets.

### Voluntary Resignation

If a team member decides to leave FlowForge they're expected to continue working to facilitate a smooth handover and enable us to find a suitable replacement. Please note that we generally expect the team member to work for the entire notice period.

If you are considering resigning from your position at FlowForge, we highly recommend discussing your reasons with your manager or the People Ops manager. We are always open to improving and making changes that benefit our team members. While we understand that sometimes leaving is the best option, we encourage you to explore all possible solutions before making a final decision.

Once you have discussed your concerns with your manager and the People Ops team and determined that resigning from FlowForge is the only option, please notify both your manager and the People Ops team of your intention to resign via email. Afterward, we will commence a discussion to establish the steps required to ensure a seamless handover.

### Involuntary Resignation

When a team member is being let go, it is usually due to either performance issues or a change in the company's needs that no longer justifies their role. If the decision is due to performance issues, we will have already provided feedback and given the team member an opportunity to improve. Unfortunately, if the issues cannot be resolved, termination of employment may be necessary. In most cases, we will ask the team member to stop working immediately. The final payment will be made according to the terms of their employment contract.

### Communicating Departures

When a team member voluntarily departs, we may ask if they would like to share their plans with the team. If the departure is involuntary, we will strive to maintain transparency regarding the reasons for the departure, while still respecting the individual's privacy.

Please note that in some instances, FlowForge may be unable to provide additional context surrounding an employee's departure.

## Offboarding process

We will send an email to the departing employee covering the following points:

Final payment
Vested share options
Return of company property
Reimbursement of business expenses

At FlowForge, we conduct Exit Interviews for employees who choose to leave the company voluntarily. This provides us with valuable feedback on their experience, reasons for leaving, and areas for improvement. The People Ops manager schedules these interviews during the employee's last week to ensure they have an opportunity to share their insights. Our aim is to use this feedback to enhance our workplace culture and practices.

### Offboarding Issue

The People Ops manager will create a new offboarding Issue for each leaver using the template maintained on GitHub, which can be viewed https://github.com/flowforge/admin/issues/166

### Final Pay

Final pay for employees leaving FlowForge will be determined based on their length of service and the reason for leaving. If the offboarding is voluntary, the employee will be paid up until their last day and any unused vacation pay will be paid out based on assuming the employee would have taken 25 days of vacation (as we offer unlimited PTO).

If offboarding is involuntary due to performance or business changes, severance pay will be provided at the sole discretion of FlowForge management.

## Share options vested

We will confirm the number of vested share options and provide information on how to exercise them, if applicable.

## Business expense

We will reimburse any outstanding expenses that comply with our handbook's reimbursement section.
