## Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)

FlowForge has templates for standard NDA's:
- [One way NDA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r6a3qgYrfKwNnNwQwx2Wp63QiC_sHGHYca8f9IR_fCI){rel="nofollow"} - When the other parties cannot share to any third parties
- [Mutual NDA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YiOQPbcEwbqpLcnrYjaui9ur1iLO_8Y3Ty4TOVJNiTk){rel="nofollow} - Neither party can discuss details outside of the listed parties

If you need these for any discussions, please ask the PeopleOps Manager to send
them to the CEO and the counterparty.

Signed NDA documents should be stored on the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1BT1KY7B18N4JWlVGEnRsovhwiGnZkm5F){rel="nofollow"} for future reference.
