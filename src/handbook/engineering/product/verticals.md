# Market Segments

By understanding the various markets in which we fit, we can align our [product strategy](./strategy.md) to meet those specific needs. For this overview, we will focus on four distinct product markets: Enterprise-Grade Node-RED, Industrial IoT Platforms, Low-Code Tools, and Data Integration Tools.

## Enterprise Grade Node-RED

For companies who are already adopting Node-RED as the base technology, they are looking for a solution to mature their use of Node-RED.

We believe FlowFuse is the only viable commercial solution in this space. Our main competitor here is in-house built solutions; where companies are faced with building their own ways to manage Node-RED securely and at scale. This is usually not their core business, so a commercial solution is an attractive alternative.

Where companies have already invested in their own automations around Node-RED, it is important for FlowFuse to demonstrate the additional value it can bring.


## Industrial IoT Platforms

An IIoT platform is a comprehensive solution that securely collects, integrates, and manages vast volumes of data from IoT endpoints. It supports various manufacturer and industry protocols, normalizing and analyzing data at the edge and in the cloud. By bridging IT and OT endpoints, it enhances asset management and promotes application development. It can supplement traditional OT functions and pivot asset-intensive industries like manufacturing or energy towards digitalization. 

An IIoT platform should fulfill key requirements like security, automation, and sustainability. It enables interoperability with various business applications. Key capabilities include device management, integration, data management, analytics, application enablement, and security (see also [IIoT platform definition](https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2C757S9J&ct=230105&st=sb)). With its prowess in connecting and processing data from IIoT devices, Node-RED finds a fitting place in the sphere of IIoT platforms, becoming an integral tool in industries like manufacturing where the utility of such data is paramount for fostering operational efficacy and stimulating innovation. Further augmenting Node-RED's proficiency, FlowFuse introduces enterprise-grade features that streamline the management of remote deployments and delivery pipelines, thus amplifying Node-RED's and FlowFuse's potential as IIoT platform.

However, a potential downside is that it may currently be perceived as too general-purpose and not specialized enough for specific IIoT tasks compared to other, more narrowly focused IIoT platforms.

### Market Size

The Industrial IoT market is expected to reach a value of $516.6 Billion by 2028 ($221.7 Billion in 2022), with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.49% from 2023 to 2028. About 30%, $66.5 Billion of this was in software alone in 2022.

### Key Customers

The primary customer base in the IIoT sector includes manufacturing, energy, transportation, and utilities companies. These businesses prioritize operational efficiency, equipment monitoring, predictive maintenance, and often operate on a global scale. They require a system capable of handling large data volumes and enabling swift, insightful decision-making.

### Participants in the market

- Ignition
- HighByte
- Tulip
- FrameworX and FactoryStudio
- Siemens Mindsphere (Digital Industry Software)
- Microsoft IoT Hub & Edge
- AWS IoT Hub & Edge (e.g. Greengras)
- PTC
- Hitachi

### Positioning

With its prowess in connecting and processing data from IIoT devices, Node-RED and FlowFuse find a fitting place in the sphere of IIoT platforms, becoming an integral tool in industries like manufacturing where the utility of such data is paramount for fostering operational efficacy and stimulating innovation. We exist to empower bottom-up innovation. We allow companies to professionalize their workflows to business critical applications.

Our market positioning is underpinned by two pivotal hypotheses that address pressing demands in the IIoT space:

1. The prevailing landscape of IIoT software solutions is full of off-the-shelf products that seldom meet the unique demands of specific use cases. This gap underscores a pressing need for flexible, adaptable solutions that can be tailored to fit the intricate requirements of diverse operational environments, ensuring a glove-like fit rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.
2. The notion that true innovation within a manufacturing landscape should emanate from a bottom-up approach is central to our philosophy. Engineers and frontline workers, immersed in the day-to-day challenges and intricacies of manufacturing processes, are uniquely positioned to identify areas ripe for innovation and improvement. By empowering these individuals with the tools and platforms to implement their insights, we can unlock a wellspring of transformative ideas and solutions that drive the industry forward.

## Low-Code Tools

Low-code platforms enable rapid application development with minimal hand-coding, which aligns well with Node-RED's offering of a visual, drag-and-drop interface for creating flow-based applications. Node-RED allows users with limited programming knowledge to create complex IoT applications, which fits well with FlowFuse's focus on collaborative development and management of Node-RED applications.

However, the potential disadvantage is that low-code tools can sometimes be viewed as less powerful or flexible than high-code platforms, and the target customers are challenging to define.

### [Market Size](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-12-13-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-low-code-development-technologies-market-to-grow-20-percent-in-2023)

The worldwide market for low-code development technologies is projected to total $26.9 billion in 2023, with growth of 19.6% from 2022 (Low-Code Tools totaled $22.462 Billion in 2022; Low-Code Application Platforms (LCAP) only $7.968 Billion in 2022).

### Participants in the market

- Mendix
- Microsoft Power Apps
- OutSystems
- Zoho Creator

### Key Customers

Businesses looking to accelerate digital transformation are the primary customers here, including both large enterprises and SMBs. These organizations need to quickly develop applications to streamline their operations, improve customer experiences, or launch innovative products.

### Positioning

FlowFuse should position itself as a comprehensive low-code platform, ideal for both novices and experienced developers. This includes emphasizing its drag-and-drop interface for application building and the ability to scale and manage applications easily. A strong focus on community-building and providing an extensive library of pre-built components can help attract a wider user base.

## Data Integration Tools

Also known as IPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service), this market serves business users looking to integrate workflows across multiple different systems. Typically, these are cloud-hosted SaaS types of systems, usually with some sort of public API. There is also the scenario of integrating between cloud systems and internal company systems or data stores.

While this is an essential function of Node-RED, it doesn't encompass all the capabilities and the broader aim of FlowFuse.

### [Market Size](https://www.vynzresearch.com/ict-media/global-ipaas-market)

The market size for IPaaS has been reported to be at least $1.4 billion in 2021, potentially growing to $12.3 billion in 2027.

### Key Customers

This category encompasses businesses in various sectors that deal with large data volumes, including e-commerce, financial services, healthcare, and supply chain management. They require a system that can consolidate data from multiple sources and make it accessible for analysis and decision-making.

### Participants in the market

Some of the companies that are in this market include:
- n8n.io
- Zapier
- IFTTT
- Dell Boomi
- OneReach.ai
- Microsoft Flow
- Workato
- Snap Logic
- tray.io
- Webmethods.io
- Mulesoft Anypoint
- Integromat
- UiPath

### Positioning

FlowFuse should highlight its capabilities as an advanced data integration platform, emphasizing its ability to simplify data collection and transmission. Showcasing partnerships with major database providers and cloud systems could enhance its appeal as a capable and versatile data integration tool.
