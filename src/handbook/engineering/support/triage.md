# Support Triage Duty

## Overview

Support triage duty is a first-line monitoring role to ensure incoming support requests are promptly acknowledged, categorized, and routed to the right department, team, or person.

At FlowFuse, we do not currently have a dedicated support team. To share the support load, keep every department connected to our users, and ensure clear ownership, we operate a **full company triage rotation**. This reflects our commitment to **proactive ownership as a company**, ensuring customers receive timely, thoughtful responses and that requests reach the right place quickly.

The goal of triage is not to solve every issue yourself, but to act as a connector and create forward motion.


## How Triage Reflects Our Values

Support triage duty is not just an operational practice. It is an expression of FlowFuse’s company values in action.

- **Results**

  Triage emphasizes initiative and outcomes over process. The focus is on creating momentum for customer requests rather than waiting for the right moment or person.

- **Iterative Improvement**

  Triage is a living system. As we learn more about customer needs, volume, and patterns, we expect both the process and this handbook to evolve.

- **Collaborative Community**

  By rotating triage across the company, customer ownership is shared rather than siloed. This keeps teams connected to real user needs and ensures information flows openly.

- **Constructive Candor**

  Triage relies on clear, respectful communication, whether acknowledging a customer, routing a ticket, or escalating internally to keep work moving.

- **Customer Empathy**

  Even when we do not yet have answers, triage ensures customers are heard, acknowledged, and supported with appropriate urgency and care.

Triage exists as a practical extension of how we work together at FlowFuse.


## The Flow: How It Works

### The Schedule

- Each Friday, the Support Coordinator announces the next **Triage Lead** in `#support-tickets`.
- Rotations last **one week (Monday to Friday)**.

### The Role

- You are the first set of eyes, not the final owner.
- Your responsibility is to acknowledge, categorize, and route requests so they reach the right place quickly.

You are not expected to be an expert, only a connector.


## Where Tickets Come From

- **Live chat** from the website support widget
- **Email** sent to `support@flowfuse.com`

All tickets appear in the [HubSpot Helpdesk](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/help-desk/26586079/).


## What to Monitor

### HubSpot

Keep the [**Unassigned Triage**](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/help-desk/26586079/view/236761036/list-view) view open during the day. If you don't have access to HubSpot, only focus on the Slack Channel noted below. 
> To note: Chatbot tickets don’t go into triage and don't appear in Slack. Only in HubSpot. 

### Slack

New tickets trigger notifications in `#support-tickets`.

> Tip: To receive badge notifications, configure the channel’s notification settings rather than relying on the bell icon.

Configuration steps:
- Open the Slack channel #support-tickets
- Click on the channel name
- Click on the second icon at the top of the screen (bell icon)
- Choose "All new posts" 

## SLA Awareness (Important)

Some customers have response-time SLAs based on their subscription.

Triage leads are not responsible for enforcing SLAs directly, but are responsible for ensuring tickets are routed and acknowledged in a way that supports them.

Current SLA definitions and response expectations are documented in the [Subscription Agreement](https://flowfuse.com/handbook/sales/subscription-agreement-1.5/).

When triaging:

- Be especially attentive to Enterprise customer tickets
- Prioritize routing and visibility for time-sensitive issues
- When unsure whether an SLA applies, escalate early in `#support-tickets`


## Severity Guide

A ticket is considered **urgent** if it involves:

- Production outages or blocked deployments
- Security or data concerns
- Enterprise customers reporting downtime or business impact
- Anything that risks breaching an SLA

When in doubt, escalate rather than waiting.


## Categorization & Routing

To route the Slack message, the triage person should follow the instructions below. 

| Category | Action |
|--------|-------|
| Sales inquiry | Tag @sales in the Slack thread of the ticket | 
| Billing inquiry | Tag @sales in the Slack thread of the ticket |
| Product support (Enterprise) | Tag @engineering in the Slack thread of the ticket |
| Product support (Team) | Tag @engineering in the Slack thread of the ticket |
| Product support (OSS or Community) | Tag @product in the Slack thread of the ticket |
| Spam (e.g. booth design offers) | Comment spam in the Slack thread of the ticket |

## Replying vs Routing

- If you can confidently answer a simple question, or you are part of the team the ticket would be routed to, you may reply directly in HubSpot if you have access.
- If the issue requires investigation or follow-up, route it to the appropriate team.

Whoever replies first in HubSpot becomes the ticket owner and will receive future notifications for that ticket. The owner can be re-assigned when appropriate.

## Ownership After Routing

Once a ticket has been replied to in HubSpot or routed in Slack, ownership sits with the assigned ticket owner or team.

If a ticket stalls after assignment/triage, responsibility for follow-up and resolution lies with the owner or owning team, not the triage role.

Triage exists to create initial clarity and forward motion, not to monitor or enforce ongoing progress.


## Slack Workflow

Use emoji reactions on ticket notifications in `#support-tickets`:

- Add 👀 `:eyes:` on the main Slack message to let the team know that:
  You are on it

- Add ✅ `:white_check_mark:` on the main Slack message to let the team know that:
  Issue has been dealt with

This keeps the channel readable and avoids unnecessary status messages.


## Vacation & OOO Coverage

The Support Coordinator reviews the rotation against Deel each week and proactively swaps anyone who is out of office.


## Rules of Engagement

- **Do not merge tickets in HubSpot**  
  Merged tickets become unsearchable due to a HubSpot limitation.

- Internal emails may still represent customer requests. Read carefully.
- When unsure, ask in `#support-tickets` or the relevant department channel.


## Handling Spam

Common spam includes booth design offers and unsolicited sales pitches.

For these:

- Click **Mark as spam** in the HubSpot Actions menu, or
- Delete the ticket
