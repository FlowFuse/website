## Process

### Art Requests

If you want something designed or drawn, then please follow the details in [Art Requests](./art-requests.md) in order to have your request be picked up by an available designer.

### Scheduling

The Design process is bound by the [Development Cadence](../development/releases/planning#cadence),
Work begins on formal design (mid and high-fidelity UX and visual design assets)
two weeks prior to a release cycle beginning.

In getting a head start on major design work, we ensure that prior thinking has been conducted on the high-level UX, and development is not blocked at the start of a release sprint. Both visual and UX design iterations will occur throughout the first two weeks of a cycle, alongside development efforts.
