## Process

### Scheduling

As per our [Development Cadence](../development#cadence), we release a new version of FlowForge every four weeks. Work begins on formal design (mid and high-fidelity UX and visual design assets) two weeks prior to a release cycle beginning, i.e. 6 weeks ahead of the release. 

In getting a head start on major design work, we ensure that prior thinking has been conducted on the high-level UX, and development is not blocked at the start of a release sprint. Both visual and UX design iterations will occur throughout the first two weeks of a cycle, alongside development efforts.
