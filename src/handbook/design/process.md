# Process

## Art Requests

If you want something designed or drawn, then please follow the details in
[Art Requests](./art-requests.md) in order to have your request be picked up by an available designer.

## Scheduling

### Product design

The Design process is bound by the [Development Cadence](../development/releases/planning#cadence).
Work begins on formal design (mid and high-fidelity UX and visual design assets)
two weeks prior to a release cycle beginning.

In getting a head start on major design work, we ensure that prior thinking has
been conducted on the high-level UX, and development is not blocked at the start
of a release sprint. Both visual and UX design iterations will occur throughout the
first two weeks of a cycle, alongside development efforts.

### Website and rest of design assets

In contrast to the platform, changes and updates to the web design can be implemented independently and are not limited to specific release cycles. The timing and order of these changes, as well as the creation of other design assets such as blog images, open graphs, presentations, illustrations, etc., depend on prioritization aligned with the company's interests.

## Design Review

This phase aims to ensure that the designs not only look visually appealing, but also effectively communicate the intended message to the audience.

To achieve this, please assess the organization of information, evaluate the readability and coherence of text, and verify the alignment with the project's objectives.

For UX/UI proposals, the design review concludes with the sign-off of Figma designs by the page owner, who is usually the DRI for the Website but may be another team member. As for the rest of the design assets, it's determined by the person who created the Art Request.

While iterations can be made during the development phase for UX/UI design in terms of content and layout, it is recommended to facilitate feedback loops during the design phase. By getting early feedback, we aim to identify and address any potential issues before entering the development phase. This approach helps streamline the design workflow, allowing for quicker iterations and ultimately saving time.

## Delivery of Art

While the art request will include a delivery method of the assets, please be
sure to also always export the asset to the [Design directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PiuFwW3H8XuydolepmfQQ4BjcdNekVQg){rel="nofollow"}
so others, non-designers, can find and reuse these assets.
