## Process

### Art Requests

If you want something designed or drawn, then please follow the details in
[Art Requests](./art-requests.md) in order to have your request be picked up by an available designer.

### Scheduling

The Design process is bound by the [Development Cadence](../development/releases/planning#cadence),
Work begins on formal design (mid and high-fidelity UX and visual design assets)
two weeks prior to a release cycle beginning.

In getting a head start on major design work, we ensure that prior thinking has
been conducted on the high-level UX, and development is not blocked at the start
of a release sprint. Both visual and UX design iterations will occur throughout the
first two weeks of a cycle, alongside development efforts.

### Delivery of Art

While the art request will include a delivery method of the assets, please be
sure to also always export the asset to the [Design directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PiuFwW3H8XuydolepmfQQ4BjcdNekVQg){rel="nofollow"}
so others, non-designers, can find and reuse these assets.
