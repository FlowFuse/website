# Process

## Art Requests

If you want something designed or drawn, then please follow the details in
[Art Requests](./art-requests.md) in order to have your request be picked up by an available designer.

## Scheduling

### Product design

The Design process is bound by the [Development Cadence](../development/releases/planning#cadence).
Work begins on formal design (mid and high-fidelity UX and visual design assets)
two weeks prior to a release cycle beginning.

In getting a head start on major design work, we ensure that prior thinking has
been conducted on the high-level UX, and development is not blocked at the start
of a release sprint. Both visual and UX design iterations will occur throughout the
first two weeks of a cycle, alongside development efforts.

### Website and rest of design assets

In contrast to the platform, changes and updates to the web design can be implemented independently and are not limited to specific release cycles. The timing and order of these changes, as well as the creation of other design assets such as blog images, open graphs, presentations, illustrations, etc., depend on prioritization aligned with the company's interests.

## Reviewing

During this phase, it is essential, whenever possible, to thoroughly review the proposed content before proceeding with the implementation in code, particularly regarding UX/UI design.

This phase aims to ensure that the design not only looks visually appealing but also effectively communicates the intended message to the audience. This includes assessing the organization of information, evaluating the readability and coherence of text, and verifying the alignment with the project's objectives.

By including a review phase in the design process, we can identify any potential issues or areas for improvement early on. This proactive approach helps streamline the overall design workflow, minimizes the need for extensive revisions at later stages, and ultimately delivers a high-quality design that meets both aesthetic and content-related requirements.

## Delivery of Art

While the art request will include a delivery method of the assets, please be
sure to also always export the asset to the [Design directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PiuFwW3H8XuydolepmfQQ4BjcdNekVQg){rel="nofollow"}
so others, non-designers, can find and reuse these assets.
