## From SQL to Opportunity

For each sales opportunity a clear answer for the customers needs and wants should be known. It boils down to the following questions:

1. Why change?
1. Why now?
1. Why FlowForge?

If, and only if, the answers are known, an opportunity is added to the HubSpot deals board.
