## Weekly Sales Meetings

The sales team conducts two scheduled meetings each week to review and manage the sales pipeline:

### Monday: Forecast Review
Every Monday, the sales team holds a forecast review meeting. This is a team-wide session that provides a high-level overview of the full pipeline from a 10,000-foot perspective. The focus is on overall pipeline health, trends, and forecasting rather than diving into specific deal details. Individual deals are only discussed when their path diverges from the common sales trajectory as outlined in the handbook and internal sales documentation.

#### Meeting Setup Process
Setting up the Monday forecast review requires manual work due to HubSpot's limitations with historical pipeline charting. The process involves using a Google Sheet to track and analyze pipeline data over time.

**Weekly Data Collection Process:**
1. Navigate to the Deals view in HubSpot
2. Ensure the view is set to list format (not board or other view types)  
3. Export all deals as a CSV file
4. Import the CSV data into the appropriate date section of the Google Sheet used for pipeline tracking

This manual process ensures consistent data collection and enables historical analysis that HubSpot's native reporting doesn't provide.

### Friday: Individual Pipeline Meetings
Each Account Executive (AE) and Customer Success Manager (CSM) has an individual pipeline meeting on Friday. These one-on-one sessions allow for detailed discussion of specific deals, challenges, and opportunities within each team member's territory or portfolio.
