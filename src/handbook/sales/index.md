## Lead status

For leads who are [MQLs or SQLs](/handbook/marketing/hubspot.md) the `Lead status`
field is used to mark what the status is. Even though they're beyond being a lead.
This field is maintained by the primary contact owner, likely the account executive.

At this stage we're using the default set of status's in HubSpot:

| Lead status | When to use |
| :---------: | :---------- |
| New | The contact in question has had only _marketing_ contact (E-mails, etc). |
| Open | In the stage where a contact is assigned to a Account exec, but no official connection has be made. Usually contacts are only in this stage for a short while.|
| Attempted to contact | From the moment the AE reached out, until there's a reply from them. |
| Connected | MQLs and SQL that have replied and engaged with FlowForge. |
| In Progress | After contact has been made, this status captures the nurturing process toward an opportunity. |
| Open Deal | When a deal is on the board, and the opportunity is real, this is the status! |
| Unqualified | Either this contact specifically cannot lead the sales process, or the account itself has been found unqualified. |
| Bad timing | FlowForge was, for whatever reason, not a great fit right now. However, it's potentially a good fit later. |

## From SQL to Opportunity

For each sales opportunity a clear answer for the customers needs and wants should be known. It boils down to the following questions:

| Question | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Why change? | What's the trigger to invest in FlowForge and Node-RED? |
| Why now? | Timeline is everything! |
| Why FlowForge? | What value does FlowForge offer, what features are of most interest? |

If, and only if, the answers are known and added as notes to HubSpot, an
opportunity is added to the HubSpot deals board.
