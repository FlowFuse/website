# Sales department

The Sales Department is more than just a revenue function — it’s a unified
commercial team responsible for building customer relationships, accelerating
adoption, enabling long-term success, and scaling the business through trusted
partnerships. This section outlines our guiding principles, key processes,
organizational structure, and tools we use to deliver on that mission.

## What we do

The Sales Department at FlowFuse plays a central role in how we deliver value to
the market and build long-term customer partnerships. Our scope spans four key
functions:

### Account Representation

We own the end-to-end process of identifying, engaging, and converting qualified
opportunities into FlowFuse customers. This includes new business development,
opportunity qualification, demos, technical validation, proposal management, and
deal closure. We work consultatively with our prospects to align our solution
with their business needs.

### Solution Engineering

We serve as trusted technical advisors across the full customer lifecycle — from
pre-sales discovery through post-sales implementation. This includes delivering
tailored demos, guiding proof-of-concept evaluations, supporting onboarding, and
providing architectural guidance. We help customers align FlowFuse with their
broader industrial transformation goals and ensure long-term technical success.

### [Customer Success](./customer-success.md)

We are responsible for the ongoing success and growth of our customers. This
includes onboarding, adoption, renewals, customer satisfaction, and expansion.
We help customers maximize the value of FlowFuse while driving maturity in their
use of Node-RED. Success is measured by outcomes, not just retention.

### [GTM Partnerships](./gtm-partnerships.md)

We establish and grow go-to-market partnerships that help expand our reach and
deliver complementary value. This includes strategic alliances, technology
partners, and service delivery partners. We support co-marketing, joint sales
motions, and partner enablement to strengthen FlowFuse’s presence in the market.

### Professional Services and Support

We provide scoped, high-impact services that accelerate customer outcomes. This
includes architecture guidance, implementation support, and enablement
engagements. Our goal is to help customers move faster and more confidently,
especially during early adoption or scaling phases.

## Team

The Sales Department is led by the
[Vice President of Sales](/team/#michael-davis), who oversees all four core
functions: Sales, Customer Success, GTM Partnerships, and Professional Services.
While each function has distinct responsibilities, we operate as a single,
collaborative department aligned around customer value and commercial growth. We
maintain a flat, transparent structure with strong cross-functional
collaboration across Product, Marketing, and Engineering. Sales leadership is
responsible for setting strategy, aligning resources, and supporting execution
across the full customer lifecycle — from first contact to long-term adoption
and advocacy.
