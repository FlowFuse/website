## Pricing

FlowForge has two commercial offerings; self-managed and FlowForge Cloud. How we
engage with customers will differentiate based on the install method and size of
the opportunity.

### Generating a Quote and Order Form

Quotes are generated through HubSpot. Each quote should link to the subsciption
agreement as well as include "Order Form" in the description. Link the latest
version of the document with the [subscription agreement](../legal/#subscription-agreement).

### Generating a license

For self-managed installs a license needs to be generated and installed to
unlock premium features. Licenses are generated by cloning the [`flowforge/flowforge`](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge)
repository and running `node forge/licensing/license-generator.js`. The missing
details can be found in 1Password.

All licenses must be added [to this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wM_o8IWjjkwi-WMRueKfS-lrmkQYzV83xm4BIzZNAO0).
