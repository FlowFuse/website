navTitle: Sales Regions
---

We manage our sales opportunities across three primary sales regions:

* Americas
* EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa)
* Oceania + East, South, and Southeast Asia

These regions are used for organizing our go-to-market efforts, account coverage, and internal reporting.

#### How to Use This Page

This page serves as the central reference for our sales territory structure and related responsibilities. It is intended for anyone managing or routing leads, coordinating handoffs, or reporting on sales activity.

#### Territory Assignments

Details on Account Executive, Sales Engineering, and Customer Success coverage by country or region can be found in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1teQVqMWtyWPWbbe6WQnp9gONyTCucWK_62h4KY7q8BE/edit?usp=sharing">Sales Territory Assignment spreadsheet</a>.

If you're unsure which region an account belongs to, use the prospectâ€™s billing country as the default reference. For exceptions (e.g., global accounts or unique organizational structures), please consult the Head of Sales.
