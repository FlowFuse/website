## Closing a deal

Follow the steps below to ensure every new customer is setup for success and quickly as possible following a sale.

### Steps

1. Once the order form is signed by the customer, you should move the deal to Closed Won in HubSpot. You do not need to wait for countersignature.

2. Once all parties have signed, download the completed Order Form and Subscritpion Agreement, and upload them to the Legal folder in Google Drive.

3. If the license is self hosted, ask ZJ to generate the key, then include in the onboarding email.

4. If it is a cloud deal, any discounts need to be setup by ZJ in Stripe. Let ZJ know which email to send the invoice to once configured.

5. Send the onboarding email with an introduction to Rob, their CSM, and the license key (if self-hosted).
