# Customer Adoption & Maturity Model

## Purpose

This page defines FlowFuse’s Customer Adoption & Maturity Model for Node-RED–based solutions in manufacturing and industrial environments.

The model provides a shared framework used across Sales, Solution Engineering, and Customer Success to:

- Understand a customer’s starting point
- Align engagement strategy to customer maturity
- Select the appropriate sales motion and evaluation approach
- Anticipate organizational and operational risk
- Guide customers toward scalable, governed adoption

This is a **segmentation and decision model**, not a sales stage or qualification checklist.

---

## The Two Axes

The model evaluates customers along two independent dimensions:

### Node-RED Adoption Maturity (Technical)

- **Low:** Isolated experiments, local usage, individual projects
- **High:** Broad Node-RED usage across teams, sites, or use cases

### Manufacturing / Operational Maturity (Organizational)

- **Low:** Ad hoc processes, limited governance, inconsistent ownership
- **High:** Standardized operations, defined governance, structured decision-making

Customers can be technically advanced but operationally immature — or vice versa.

---

## The Four Zones

### Z3 — Experimental / Tooling (Local Use)

**Profile**
- Individual engineers or small teams experimenting
- Ad hoc projects and local success
- Limited organizational visibility or sponsorship

**Characteristics**
- Low operational maturity
- Low Node-RED adoption maturity

**Typical needs**
- Education and enablement
- Use-case validation
- Proof of value at the local level

**Primary motion**
- Early discovery
- Solution-led evaluation
- Education-focused demos

---

### Z2 — Manufacturing-First (Solution-Led)

**Profile**
- Outcome-driven manufacturing or operations teams
- Structured buyers solving specific problems
- Clear business objectives, limited platform thinking

**Characteristics**
- High operational maturity
- Lower Node-RED adoption maturity

**Typical needs**
- Solution alignment
- Business impact validation
- Confidence that the approach will scale later

**Primary motion**
- **Edge Connectivity sales process**
- Solution-focused PoC
- Outcome-based evaluation

---

### Z4 — NR Scale, but Ops-Immature

**Profile**
- Widespread Node-RED usage across teams or sites
- Organic growth without centralized governance
- Increasing operational, security, and reliability risk

**Characteristics**
- High Node-RED adoption maturity
- Low operational maturity

**Typical needs**
- Governance and control
- Standardization
- Risk reduction and operational visibility

**Primary motion**
- **NR Scale sales process**
- Risk- and governance-led evaluation
- Platform and operating model alignment

---

### Z1 — Platform-Oriented Manufacturers

**Profile**
- Node-RED adopted as a strategic platform
- Governed, standardized operations
- Central ownership and clear operating model

**Characteristics**
- High operational maturity
- High Node-RED adoption maturity

**Typical needs**
- Optimization and expansion
- Platform hardening
- Long-term roadmap alignment

**Primary motion**
- Expansion and scale
- Strategic platform discussions
- Multi-year value planning

---

## How to Identify the Zone (Pre-Meeting Questions)

Use the following questions **before or during early discovery** to determine a customer’s likely zone.

### Node-RED Adoption Signals

- Where is Node-RED running today?
- How many teams or sites are using it?
- Is usage centralized, shared, or entirely local?
- Who owns Node-RED standards, if anyone?

### Operational / Organizational Signals

- How are deployments governed today?
- Who is responsible for security, access, and updates?
- How do teams ensure consistency across projects?
- What happens when something breaks?

### Decision Framing Signals

- Are they trying to **solve a specific problem**, or **define how problems should be solved going forward**?
- Is risk a growing concern, or is speed the priority?
- Is leadership asking “does this work?” or “can this scale safely?”

The goal is **not to label customers**, but to select the **right engagement strategy**.

## How This Model Is Used

This model is referenced across the Commercial Organization to:

- Select the appropriate sales process (Edge vs NR Scale)
- Shape discovery and PoC design
- Anticipate organizational friction and objections
- Guide Customer Success adoption planning
- Align internal teams on customer context

This model should be revisited as customers mature over time.

Customers can — and should — move between zones.
