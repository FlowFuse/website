# Customer Journey

## Purpose

This page describes how the Commercial Organization supports customers across the full customer journey at FlowFuse.  
It defines lifecycle stages, primary ownership, and cross-functional collaboration to ensure a consistent, coordinated experience from initial engagement through renewal and expansion.

The customer journey is not linear in practice, but clear stage ownership helps reduce friction, confusion, and risk as customers progress.

## Customer Lifecycle Overview

FlowFuse organizes the customer journey into the following high-level stages:

1. Awareness & Initial Engagement
