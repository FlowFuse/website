# NR Scale Sales Process

## Purpose

The NR Scale sales process is designed for organizations that have already adopted Node-RED and are now facing challenges related to scale, governance, security, reliability, and organizational adoption.

This process helps customers move from fragmented or experimental Node-RED usage to a controlled, enterprise-ready operating model.

---

## When to Use This Process

This process applies when:

- Node-RED is already in use across teams, sites, or use cases
- The customer has committed to Node-RED as a strategic technology
- Pain is driven by scale, risk, or operational fragility — not evaluation
- The buyer is seeking a **management and governance framework**, not a new tool

This is **not** an early-stage evaluation or proof-of-value motion.

---

## Sales Motion Overview

The NR Scale process is a **risk-reduction and standardization motion**, not a feature-led sale.

Primary buyer concerns typically include:
- Security and access control
- Deployment consistency
- Operational visibility
- Compliance and auditability
- Long-term scalability and maintainability

The sales motion progresses by:
1. Diagnosing operational risk
2. Quantifying business impact
3. Validating a scalable operating model
4. Reducing technical and organizational uncertainty
5. Securing executive alignment

## Process Stages and Meetings

### Meeting 1a: Discovery

**Goal:** Understand the current Node-RED footprint, operating model, and sources of risk before introducing solutions.

**Focus areas:**
- Where and how Node-RED is deployed today
- Ownership and governance gaps
- Operational pain, fragility, and risk exposure
- Stakeholders and decision-making structure

**Exit signal:**  
Clear articulation of operational pain and agreement to explore impact.

---

### Meeting 1b: Impact / Technical Deep Dive

**Goal:** Diagnose operational impact, quantify risk, and define the critical event driving change.

**Focus areas:**
- Architecture and deployment patterns
- Security, compliance, and reliability gaps
- Cost of inaction (downtime, rework, risk)
- Timeline and triggering events

**Exit signal:**  
Agreement on impact, urgency, and evaluation scope.

---

### Meeting 2a: Champion Demo

**Goal:** Equip the champion to confidently advocate internally by connecting FlowFuse capabilities to their specific challenges.

**Focus areas:**
- Mapping problems to operating model improvements
- Demonstrating governance, control, and visibility
- Addressing internal skepticism or objections

**Exit signal:**  
Champion alignment and internal momentum.

---

### Meeting 2b: Stakeholder Demo / Workshop

**Goal:** Build cross-functional alignment and surface objections early.

**Focus areas:**
- Executive and technical stakeholder concerns
- Validation of proposed operating model
- Risk, security, and compliance discussions
- Agreement on evaluation approach

**Exit signal:**  
Buying committee alignment and PoC agreement.

---

### Meeting 3: PoC Kickoff

**Goal:** Define success criteria and remove technical uncertainty.

**Focus areas:**
- PoC objectives and scope
- Success metrics and validation criteria
- Roles, responsibilities, and timeline
- Risk areas to explicitly test

**Exit signal:**  
Clear PoC plan with agreed success criteria.

---

### Meeting 4: PoC Review

**Goal:** Validate solution fit and confirm the business case.

**Focus areas:**
- PoC results vs success criteria
- Operational improvements demonstrated
- Remaining risks or gaps
- Readiness to proceed commercially

**Exit signal:**  
Decision to proceed to proposal.

---

### Meeting 5: Proposal & Timeline Review

**Goal:** Align on commercial terms and rollout plan.

**Focus areas:**
- Pricing and packaging
- Deployment and expansion assumptions
- Implementation approach
- Contractual considerations

**Exit signal:**  
Alignment on proposal and path to close.

---

### Meeting(s) 6: Executive / Procurement Review + Close

**Goal:** Secure formal commitment.

**Focus areas:**
- Executive confirmation of value and ROI
- Procurement and legal finalization
- Decision-maker approval

**Exit signal:**  
Signed agreement.

---

## Key Principles

- Lead with **risk and governance**, not features
- Avoid positioning FlowFuse as “another tool”
- Anchor decisions to operational impact and scale
- Surface objections early and explicitly
- Progress only when intent and alignment are real

---

## Ownership and Collaboration

- **Sales** owns opportunity progression and commercial outcomes
- **Solution Engineering** owns technical validation and risk reduction
- **Customer Success** prepares for post-sale adoption and scale
- **Professional Services** supports scoped acceleration where required
