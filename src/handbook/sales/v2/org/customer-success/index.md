# Customer Success

Customer Success owns post-sale engagement with the goal of driving durable adoption, renewal readiness, and long-term customer outcomes.

Customer Success exists to protect and grow customer value over time, ensuring that commercial commitments translate into real-world impact.

## Collaboration Model

Customer Success works in close partnership with other functions in the Commercial Organization:

- **Sales Department**  
  Owns commercial negotiation, expansion sales, and renewals.  
  CS provides context, health signals, and recommendations to inform commercial discussions.

- **Solution Engineering**  
  Supports advanced use cases, technical validation, and ongoing solution optimization.

- **Professional Services**  
  Collaborates on scoped delivery and enablement where additional services accelerate adoption.

Customer Success does not negotiate contracts or pricing but plays a critical role in ensuring customers are prepared for renewal and expansion discussions.
