# Sales Department

## Purpose

The Sales Department at FlowFuse is responsible for leading customer-facing commercial engagements from initial qualification through contract execution.  
Sales owns opportunity progression, commercial outcomes, and deal accountability, while working in close collaboration with other functions across the Commercial Organization.

Sales at FlowFuse is not a transactional function. It operates as the primary orchestrator of complex, multi-stakeholder buying processes and is accountable for guiding customers toward informed, high-confidence decisions.

The Sales Department owns:

- Opportunity qualification and prioritization

Sales is accountable for **commercial outcomes**, even when execution involves Solution Engineering, Customer Success, Professional Services, or Sales Partnerships.

  Provides input on adoption risks, renewal considerations, and expansion opportunities.

- **Professional Services**  
  Supports scoped delivery planning, enablement, and services-led engagements.

While collaboration is essential, **Sales remains accountable** for opportunity progression and commercial decision-making.
