# Sales Partnerships

## Purpose

The Sales Partnerships function at FlowFuse is responsible for building, enabling, and scaling partner-led and partner-assisted commercial motions.  
Sales Partnerships exists to extend FlowFuse’s reach, accelerate adoption in specific markets or industries, and complement direct Sales efforts through trusted partners.

Partnerships are treated as a deliberate go-to-market strategy, not an opportunistic channel.

## Collaboration Model

Sales Partnerships works in close coordination with other functions in the Commercial Organization:

- **Sales Department**  
  Owns opportunity qualification, progression, and commercial close.  
  Sales Partnerships supports partner involvement within Sales-owned processes.

- **Solution Engineering**  
  Supports technical enablement for partners and validates partner-led solutions when required.

- **Customer Success**  
  Collaborates where partners are involved in post-sale delivery or ongoing customer support.

- **Professional Services**  
  Coordinates delivery responsibilities when partners participate in implementation or enablement.

Sales Partnerships does not own customer relationships independently of Sales.
