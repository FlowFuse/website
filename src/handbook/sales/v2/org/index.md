# Commercial Organization

## Purpose

The Commercial Organization at FlowFuse is responsible for guiding customers from initial engagement through adoption, expansion, and long-term success.  
It owns the customer-facing commercial motions that turn product capability into realized business value.

This organization balances revenue responsibility with customer outcomes, ensuring that growth is durable, scalable, and aligned with how customers actually adopt and operate FlowFuse.

## Scope and Responsibilities

The Commercial Organization owns:
- Customer engagement from first commercial interaction through renewal and expansion
- Commercial qualification, progression, and close
- Technical validation and solution alignment
- Customer onboarding, adoption, and renewal readiness
- Scoped delivery and enablement services
- Partner-led commercial motions

While individual functions own specific processes, the Commercial Organization operates as a coordinated system with shared accountability for customer and commercial outcomes.
