# Solution Engineering

## Purpose

The Solution Engineering (SE) function at FlowFuse is responsible for technical discovery, validation, and solution alignment throughout the commercial lifecycle.  
SE ensures that proposed solutions are technically sound, appropriately scoped, and aligned with the customer’s architecture, constraints, and intended outcomes.

Solution Engineering exists to **reduce technical and delivery risk** while enabling confident customer decisions.

## Scope and Responsibilities

Solution Engineering owns:

- Technical discovery and requirements clarification
- Architecture assessment and solution design
- Technical validation of proposed use cases
- Demo execution aligned to customer context
- Proof of Concept (PoC) technical delivery and evaluation
- Technical risk identification and mitigation
- Technical handoff to Customer Success and Professional Services

SE is accountable for **technical correctness and feasibility**, not commercial outcomes.

## Solution Engineering–Owned Processes

Solution Engineering owns the following technical processes, typically executed in support of Sales-led motions:

- Technical discovery and architecture assessment
- Demo planning and execution
- Proof of Concept (PoC) delivery and evaluation
- Technical onboarding and enablement
- Technical expansion identification (where additional use cases emerge)

Detailed process documentation will be added as these processes are formalized.

## Collaboration Model

Solution Engineering works in close partnership with other functions in the Commercial Organization:

- **Sales Department**  
  Leads opportunity qualification, progression, and commercial decision-making.  
  SE supports by validating technical fit and reducing implementation risk.

- **Customer Success**  
  Receives technical context and architectural intent during handoff to support adoption and long-term success.

- **Professional Services**  
  Collaborates on scoped delivery planning, especially where services are required to accelerate or de-risk implementation.

- **Sales Partnerships**  
  Supports partner-led opportunities by validating technical approaches and integration patterns.

SE participates in customer engagements but does not own commercial negotiation or forecasting.

## Engagement Principles

Solution Engineering engagements are guided by the following principles:

- Be outcome-oriented, not feature-led
- Validate assumptions early and explicitly
- Surface technical risk rather than minimizing it
- Align recommendations to customer maturity and operating model
- Enable informed decision-making, even when that decision is to not proceed

---

## Metrics and Accountability

Solution Engineering effectiveness is measured by:

- Quality and clarity of technical discovery
- PoC success rates against agreed criteria
- Reduction of downstream implementation risk
- Alignment between proposed architecture and delivered outcomes
- Quality of technical handoffs to Customer Success and Professional Services

---

## Tools and Systems

Solution Engineering primarily uses:

- Shared demo and sandbox environments
- Documentation tools for architecture and solution design
- Collaboration tools for customer workshops and technical sessions
- Internal knowledge bases and reference architectures

Detailed tool usage is documented separately.

## How This Page Is Used

This page defines **what Solution Engineering owns**.  
Detailed execution guidance is documented in:

- Sales process pages
- SE-specific process documentation
- Enablement and reference materials

This separation keeps ownership clear while allowing execution practices to evolve.
