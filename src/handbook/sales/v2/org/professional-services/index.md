# Professional Services

## Purpose

The Professional Services (PS) function at FlowFuse provides scoped, paid services to accelerate customer implementation, reduce delivery risk, and support complex or time-sensitive deployments.  
Professional Services exists to help customers achieve outcomes faster when additional expertise, capacity, or structure is required beyond standard onboarding and support.

Professional Services engagements are intentional, outcome-driven, and time-bound.

---

## Scope and Responsibilities

Professional Services owns:

- Scoping and delivery of paid customer engagements
- Implementation support for complex architectures or deployments
- Enablement services, including workshops and tailored training
- Acceleration of onboarding and time-to-value
- Delivery of agreed project outcomes within defined scope
- Structured handoff to Customer Success at engagement completion

Professional Services is accountable for **successful delivery of scoped engagements**, not for ongoing account ownership or renewal outcomes.

## Professional Services–Owned Processes

Professional Services owns the following delivery-focused processes:

- Engagement scoping and proposal definition
- Project planning and execution
- Delivery of enablement services (workshops, training, guided implementation)
- Progress tracking and status communication
- Post-engagement handoff to Customer Success

Detailed process documentation will be added as these processes are formalized.

## Collaboration Model

Professional Services works closely with other functions in the Commercial Organization:

- **Sales Department**  
  Owns commercial negotiation and contract execution.  
  PS supports Sales by defining scope, effort, and delivery assumptions.

- **Solution Engineering**  
  Collaborates on technical architecture and implementation approach, especially during complex deployments.

- **Customer Success**  
  Receives structured handoff at the conclusion of services engagements to ensure continuity of adoption and support.

- **Sales Partnerships**  
  Coordinates delivery where partners are involved in implementation or enablement.

Professional Services does not own ongoing customer relationships or commercial expansion.

- Be scoped, time-bound, and outcome-oriented

## Metrics and Accountability
