navTitle: Sales Meetings
---

To understand the prospective customers needs and how FlowFuse can help a process
has been created to enhance their experience. Almost all engagements with customers
are on virtual sites, generally Google Meet.

## Meeting a customer

For internal training purposes all sales calls should be recorded after getting
explicit consent from the customer. On request of the customer, the recording
will be shared.

The organizer of the meeting should perform pre-call preparation, including
research on the prospective customer, any goals they have shared, any goals we
have, and any relevant background information so all FlowFuse participants can
know what to expect.

For each meeting, be 2 minutes early. This allows everyone to check their setup
and sync up what the goals are for the meeting.

## Meeting structure

The number of times FlowFuse will meet with a customer depends mostly on the
customer. However, in all cases FlowFuse would like to have an initial
[Discovery Call](/handbook/sales/meetings/discovery/).

A discovery call is generally followed by a [Demo](/handbook/sales/meetings/demo/). 

To validate the solution to the problem the customer is experiencing, FlowFuse will
aid in a [POC](/handbook/sales/meetings/poc/).

## Using Fathom Notetaker

Fathom Notetaker is an AI-powered tool we use to record, transcribe, and summarize meetings efficiently. This guide will help beginners get started with Fathom, ensuring you can focus on collaboration rather than manual note-taking.

### Install Fathom

1. Download the Fathom desktop app from the official website (https://fathom.video/) or install the browser extension for your preferred video conferencing platform (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet).
1. Sign in using your FlowFuse-provided email to ensure proper team integration.
1. Link your Google Calendar to allow Fathom to auto-join your meetings.

### Join a Meeting

1. Open your video conferencing tool and start or join a meeting as usual.
1. Fathom should detect the active meeting automatically and appear in the waiting room at the scheduled start time. Occasionally there will be a small delay.
1 . If the "FlowFuse Notetaker" does not appear after a minute, you can manually invite it by clicking the Fathom logo on the lower left side of the Google Meet control bar.

### Let Fathom Record

1. Once activated, Fathom will record audio, transcribe speech in real-time, and identify speakers. No action is needed during the meeting — focus on the conversation!
1. If you want to highlight a key moment, click the “Highlight” button in Fathom’s interface (a star icon) to mark it for later.

### Review Notes Post-Meeting

1. After the meeting ends, Fathom will process the recording (this takes a few minutes). You’ll receive a notification when it’s ready.
1. Access the transcription and AI-generated summary via the Fathom dashboard (log in at fathom.video). Check the “Highlights” section for flagged moments.
1. You can prompt the AI for specific questions based on the call using the "Ask Fathom" section.

### Share with the Team

1. Click “Share” in the Fathom dashboard to generate a link or download the notes as a PDF.
1. Paste the link in our team Slack channel or email it to relevant colleagues—keep everyone in the loop effortlessly.

### Sharing externally

1. Prior to sharing the call with external attendees, ensure there is no internal dialogue included before or after they joined.
1. If there are portions you'd like to remove, go to the "Transcript" tab, find the parts to remove and click the three buttons on the right side of the text. This will allow you to remove specific portions or entire conversations. The video and transcript are both clipped using this method, although it may take a few minutes to reflect changes.
