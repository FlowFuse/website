### External Calls

For internal training purposes all sales calls should be recorded after getting
explicit consent from the customer. On request of the customer, the recording
will be shared.

The organizer of the meeting should perform pre-call preparation, including research on the prospective customer, any goals they have shared, any goals we have, and any relevant background information so all FlowFuse participants can know what to expect.

For each meeting, try to be 2 minutes early. This allows everyone to check their setup
and sync up what the goals are for the meeting.
