### External Calls

For internal training purposes all sales calls should be recorded after getting
explicit consent from the customer. On request of the customer, the recording
will be shared.

The organizer of the meeting should perform pre-call preparation, including research on the prospective customer, any goals they have shared, any goals we have, and any relevant background information so all FlowFuse participants can know what to expect.

For each meeting, try to be 2 minutes early. This allows everyone to check their setup
and sync up what the goals are for the meeting.

## POC

Every POC call should have an engineer present.

### Cloud trial

If the prospect would like to trial FlowFuse Cloud, they are able to self-service at https://app.flowfuse.com/account/create. If they would like to test with Teams or Enterprise features, you can apply a coupon code to their Stripe account and elevate their Tier, after they create their trial account.

### Self-hosted trial

If a self-hosted trial is desired, you need to generate a license key.
