navTitle: Discovery Meeting
---

The goal of the discovery call is to get to know the prospective client and the
problem that FlowFuse may be able to help them.

FlowFuse will use the "Discovery Call Playbook" in Hubspot, [Learn how to use
playbooks](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/playbooks/use-playbooks#use-playbooks-in-contact-company-deal-ticket-or-custom-crm-records).

The next step depends on the outcome of the call, but usually results in a more technical discussion, product demonstration, or sending relevant content to follow-up on at an appropriate time in the future.
## Low Latency Meeting

A "low-latency" meeting can be scheduled on our website to make sure customers
can find help without much delay when they need it. When someone requests a call,
it connects directly to our team’s calendars — meaning any of us may end up
speaking with an interested prospect within minutes. Like if we were in an
actual office and the phone rings, someone has to pick it up. 

These calls are short (10–15 minutes) and are not about closing a deal. The goal
is simply to have a friendly first conversation, capture who is having an issue,
help them get the right help from the Company, and then pass the lead to the
most relevant sales teammate.

To make this easy, we’ve prepared a simple playbook with a step-by-step guide on how to handle these calls: [Discovery Call Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mzv1c7qEHQ_Pg6tJVuMrRRxNTiDx_aeEW9052aSJVeo/edit?usp=sharing).

**Low Latency Chatflow

We’ve set up a low-latency chatflow on our website to make sure we don’t miss potential customers. When someone requests a quick call, it connects directly to our team’s calendars — meaning any of us may end up speaking with an interested prospect within minutes. Like if we were in an actual office and the phone rings, someone has to pick it up. 

These calls are short (10–15 minutes) and are not about closing a deal. The goal is simply to have a friendly first conversation, capture key information, and then pass the lead to the most relevant sales teammate.
