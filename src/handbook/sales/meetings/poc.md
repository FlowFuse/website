## POC

Every POC call should have an engineer present.

### Cloud trial

If the prospect would like to trial FlowFuse Cloud, they are able to self-service at https://app.flowfuse.com/account/create. If they would like to test with Teams or Enterprise features, you can apply a coupon code to their Stripe account and elevate their Tier, after they create their trial account.

### Self-hosted trial

If a self-hosted trial is desired, you need to generate a license key. See below.

### Generating a license

For self-managed installs a license needs to be generated and installed to
unlock premium features. Licenses are generated by cloning the [`flowforge/flowforge`](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse)
repository and running `node forge/licensing/license-generator.js`. The missing
details can be found in 1Password.

All licenses must be added [to this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wM_o8IWjjkwi-WMRueKfS-lrmkQYzV83xm4BIzZNAO0).
