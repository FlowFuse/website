## Reseller Agreement

For reseller partnerships, please refer to our [Reseller Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaRahdTSWYxMvejAXlg0FT-WYXXpcEEKKMPGDtrhf4g). Upon signing, partners will also receive access to our [Deal Registration Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16_ebDfXdC9tenUOhOA5-sTDnJBN2aqTZ4vmqmfJ7v9I) for opportunity tracking.

## Partnership Requirements

When there's interest in becoming a partner FlowFuse requires a project to colaborate on jointly.
Implementation projects structure the partnership and learning on both sides.

Please [contact us](https://flowfuse.com/partners/) to discuss and complete an agreement.
