# Partnerships

## System Integrators

FlowFuse partners with System Integrators in manufacturing. Our goal is
their success, so our program prioritizes practical training and support.

We believe the best way to start a partnership is to work on a project
together. This hands-on approach structures the learning process for both
our teams and builds a strong foundation for you to successfully deliver
solutions to your clients.

If you're an SI and looking to partner, please [contact us](/partners/).

## Legal paperwork

For FlowFuse employees, the [standard terms][terms] are provided to partners
to cover the legal side.
