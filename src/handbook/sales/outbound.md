# Outbound Sales

At FlowFuse, sales representatives are expected to activate 30% of the leads in
their own pipeline through proactive outbound efforts. This handbook page sets
the tools and required practices for effective outbound sales activities.

For more information on how leads are categorized, see
[Lead Activation](/handbook/marketing/lead-activation/#outbound-push).

## Recording Activity in HubSpot

FlowFuse uses HubSpot as the single source of truth for all customer interactions.
Capture every activity, every time. This ensures visibility across the team,
accurate reporting, and effective pipeline management.

You must log all of the following activities in HubSpot:

- Phone Calls
- Emails (automated via integrations or manual)
- [Meetings](/handbook/sales/meetings/)
- Tasks
- LinkedIn Interaction
   - Use the **LinkedIn HubSpot integration** to automatically record your LinkedIn interactions

## Playbooks and Documentation

As we're scaling the outbound motion, document your strategies and results by
recording successful approaches in your personal playbook and sharing wins and
learnings with the team in the #dept-sales Slack channel. Test different
messaging and track what resonates, then continuously refine your approach.
