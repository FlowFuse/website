# Account Executives

## Purpose

The Account Executives at FlowFuse are responsible for leading customer-facing commercial engagements from initial qualification through contract execution.
Account Executives own opportunity progression, commercial outcomes, and deal accountability, while working in close collaboration with other functions across the Commercial Organization.

Account Executives at FlowFuse are not a transactional function. They operate as the primary orchestrators of complex, multi-stakeholder buying processes and are accountable for guiding customers toward informed, high-confidence decisions.

## Scope and Responsibilities

Account Executives own:

- Managing all leads from [MQL stage](/handbook/sales/hubspot/#mql-follow-up-expectations) onwards, including daily review and outreach
- Generating 30% of their own pipeline through [Cold Outbound](/handbook/sales/hubspot/#outbound) activities
- Opportunity qualification and prioritization
- Deal progression through defined sales stages
- Commercial positioning and value articulation
- Pricing, proposals, and contract negotiation
- Forecast accuracy and pipeline discipline
- Commercial close and handoff readiness

Account Executives are accountable for **commercial outcomes**, even when execution involves Solution Engineering, Customer Success, Professional Services, or Sales Partnerships.

## Sales-Owned Processes

Account Executives own the following customer-facing sales processes. These processes define *how* Account Executives engage customers in different buying contexts.

- **Edge Connectivity Sales Process**
  Used when customers are evaluating how to standardize or modernize edge connectivity across systems or sites.
  → [View process](/handbook/sales/processes/)

- **Node-RED Scale Sales Process**
  Used when customers are already using Node-RED and need governance, security, and scale.
  → _Coming soon_

Each process defines meeting goals, exit criteria, and collaboration points with other functions.

## Collaboration Model

Account Executives operate in close partnership with other functions in the Commercial Organization:

- **Solution Engineering**
  Supports technical discovery, demos, and proof-of-concept delivery.

- **Customer Success**
  Provides input on adoption risks, renewal considerations, and expansion opportunities.

- **Professional Services**
  Supports scoped delivery planning, enablement, and services-led engagements.

- **Sales Partnerships**
  Supports partner-led and co-sell opportunities.

While collaboration is essential, **Account Executives remain accountable** for opportunity progression and commercial decision-making.
