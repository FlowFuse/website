# Content Distribution

Content distribution ensures that content reaches the right audience efficiently and effectively. Even the most valuable content has limited impact if it is not properly shared. This is a separate activity that the company performs from official accounts.  

It involves publishing and promoting content across multiple platforms such as community forums and social media to maximize visibility, engagement, and reach while maintaining consistent messaging. All members of the company are encouraged to participate in content distribution, especially the author, technical writer, and Developer Advocate, since they are closest to the content and understand its context best.

## Distribution Channels

- **Node-RED Slack** — [https://node-red.slack.com](https://node-red.slack.com)  

- **Node-RED Reddit** — [https://www.reddit.com/r/nodered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nodered/)   

- **FlowFuse Reddit** — [https://www.reddit.com/r/FlowFuse/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlowFuse/)  

- **Node-RED Forum** — [https://discourse.nodered.org/](https://discourse.nodered.org/)  

- **Discord** — [https://discord.gg/Rgt72N9M](https://discord.gg/Rgt72N9M)

These are some of the key community channels. You are encouraged to share content on other relevant subreddits, Slack channels, or forums as well.

## How to Share

Before sharing content, create a simple sharing plan to ensure consistency and avoid duplication. A good plan helps you decide where, when, and how to post for maximum engagement.

### Identify the Audience

Choose channels based on who will benefit most from the content. In addition to the key community channels, you can prepare a list of relevant subreddits, forums, Slack workspaces, and Discord servers that align with the topic or content type. Focus on spaces where audience is most likely to engage and find value in the content.

### Review Rules

Before posting, review the rules and guidelines of each channel, forum, or server. This ensures that your content is shared respectfully and reduces the risk of being banned or blocked. Pay attention to posting formats, self-promotion policies, and community-specific requirements.

### Choose the Timing

Decide when to share content based on the activity patterns of your target audience. Posting during peak hours increases visibility and engagement. For global communities, consider the most active time zones of your audience, such as morning or early afternoon in regions where the majority of members are active.  

## Choosing a Title and Writing the Post

The title is the first thing people notice, so it should be clear, concise, and directly reflect what the content is about. Focus on what you did, created, or solved rather than generic phrases. For example, “Built an MCP Server in Node-RED with FlowFuse” immediately shows the achievement.  

Include relevant tools or technologies in the title when possible, and keep it short, ideally 6–10 words. Using a personal tone, like “I” instead of “we,” often makes the post feel more authentic and relatable.  

When writing the post, start by summarizing what you did and why it matters. Provide context about the tools or environment used, and keep the content easy to read with short paragraphs. Adjust the tone slightly depending on the platform: Slack and Discord posts can be more friendly and conversational, while Reddit or forum posts should be clear and focused on problem-solving.

## Engagement

After sharing content, actively engage with your audience to increase reach and build relationships. Respond to comments, questions, or feedback promptly and in a friendly, professional manner. Liking and acknowledging user interactions encourages further engagement and helps the content gain visibility.  

Monitor how the content performs across different channels, noting which posts receive the most interactions or clicks. This information can guide future content distribution decisions, helping you understand what resonates best with each community.  

Avoid leaving posts unattended, as lack of engagement can reduce reach and impact.

## Deciding Between Node-RED and FlowFuse Channels

When distributing content, it can sometimes be confusing where to post. For example, on the Node-RED Discourse forum, should it go in the **General** category or **FlowFuse/Vendor** category? On Slack, should it be shared in **#general** or **#flowfuse**?  

A simple guideline is to focus on the audience and relevance while keeping the Node-RED community in mind. If the content benefits the broader Node-RED community, such as tutorials, integrations, or general workflows, post it in Node-RED-specific categories or channels. If the content is specific to FlowFuse, like features or workflows that only work with FlowFuse, share it in FlowFuse-specific channels. This ensures the content reaches the right audience while still supporting and engaging the Node-RED community.

## LinkedIn Posting Guidelines

Sharing content on your personal LinkedIn account can increase reach and engagement, helping your network see and interact with the content. However, LinkedIn is the company’s primary channel, so articles, updates, or announcements should ideally appear there first to maintain visibility and consistent messaging.  

Instead of waiting for the company account to post, you can post content yourself directly from the company LinkedIn account. For guidance, see: [Content Ownership & Real-Time Decisions](https://flowfuse.com/handbook/marketing/social-media/#content-ownership-%26-real-time-decisions). Before posting, always discuss your plans with the social media manager to ensure alignment and avoid conflicts.

## Things to Avoid

- Posting content that is overly promotional, off-topic, or irrelevant to the audience.  
- Using clickbait titles or exaggerating claims.
- Posting too frequently or duplicating the same content across multiple channels in a short time.  
- Ignoring community rules or guidelines.  
- Engaging in arguments or negative discussions.  
- Making posts overly long or difficult to read; keep content clear and easy to scan.
