## HubSpot

We use [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) to track and manage all of our customer interactions.
It enables the creation of customer contacts, and then logging of emails/notes associated to that customer.

### Creating Contacts

Given that we have multiple client-facing roles within FlowForge, it's important to document those that
we talk to to ensure no crossover in sales and conversations.

#### Lifecycle Stage

All contacts in HubSpot need to have a defined lifecycle. It is required that all contacts pass through each lifecycle stage at the appropriate time based on their interaction with FlowForge marketing and sales. Contacts should not skip a stage. It is up to the contact owner to ensure their contacts have the appropriate lifecycle stage set.

The folowing is a description of each stage. 

| Lifecycle Stage|Description
| - | - |
| Subscriber | Contact has signed up to hear more information, when it is available, about FlowForge, e.g. newsletter subscriber |
| Lead | Contact that has converted on our website, or through some other interaction, with our organisation beyond a subscription sign up. For example, registered for a webinar, signed up for a free trial, etc.|
| Marketing Qualified Lead | The contact has requested to talk to someone directly at FlowForge about the product/services of FlowForge, either through book a demo, contact us, or direct outreach to a FlowForge employee. Support requests are not considered MQL. |
| Sales Qualified Lead | After the initial discussion with an MQL, the sales team will qualify if the contact is a potential customer by changing the lifecycle stage to SQL. This status of this stage is then further qualified in the [Lead Status](#lead-status) property. |
| Opportunity | A contact becomes an Opportunity once a Deal has been opened. A deal is opened once the sales qualification questions have been answered.  |
| Customer | An active, paying, user of FlowForge. |
| Evangelist | FlowForge will not actively use Evangelist lifecycle stage. |
| Other | Does not fit into any of the other descriptions, likely someone we are talking to about FlowForge, but will never be a paying customer, .e.g. Partners |

#### Lead Status

When defining a new contact in HubSpot, an option exists to define the "Lead Status", this section
details your options here, and when to use the respective value:

| Lead Status | Description |
| - | - |
| None | - |
| Attempted to Contact | A member of FlowForge has reached out to this contact, but is yet to receive a response. |
| Connected | Two-way conversation has undertaken, but not yet qualified as a Lead. A lead with this status may still be waiting on a booked meeting with a decision-maker on their team or may still be working to establish a budget. |
| Open Deal | Contact has expressed interest in buying FlowForge, and negotiations are actively open. |
| Unqualified | Contact is no longer interested in FlowForge. |


### Recommended Apps

We have several extension applications for HubSpot, these are a few that can be beneficial if you're interacting with customers:

- **G-Mail Extension ([link](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/ecosystem/26586079/marketplace/apps/sales/sales-enablement/gmail))** - Automatically creates contacts when you e-mail them for the first time, and logs e-mail activity against that contact in HubSpot.
