# How the marketing team works at FlowFuse

## What to work on

Due to the broad range of functions in the marketing functions at FlowFuse,
there's a large degree of freedom what to pick up, and when to pick it up.

To keep the company updated and remove the need for lots of status reporting
during meetings each individual is responsible for keeping _all_ tasks one works
on that take more than two hours in the [marketing issue tracker](https://github.com/FlowFuse/marketing/issues).

## Scheduling and Planning

The marketing team creates tasks, stories, and epics just like our engineering
team. The CEO currently does planning in 1:1s with each individual
contributor.

## Requesting Marketing support

If you would like to see the Marketing team create and publish content as a demo, blog post, or social media post, follow these steps:
1. Create issues in the Customer repo and put them in the Marketing Department Work Schedule project with 'No Status'.
2. Discuss the issues with the Product Marketing Manager to ensure that expectations are in line with Marketing priorities and timelines.
3. Add these items to the [Content Planner spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YGaP62WBqtfYsYGSgp2HA9i6u29SFHkow8tYzQwC_uU/edit?usp=sharing).

The Product Marketing Manager will validate timelines and deliverables.
