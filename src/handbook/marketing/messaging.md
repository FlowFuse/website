# {{ navTitle }}

Clear and consistent messaging serves as a cornerstone for our company to
achieve growth and a bigger market presence. The messaging framework is
essential for the company to communicate its value, purpose, and
differentiation, to in turn effectively acquire and retain our customer base.

Consistency of messaging is important; with our growing company we’ve got
limited resources and thus it’s imperative to make a significant impact quickly.
If that fails, the company must learn quickly and iterate. When the messaging is
consistent the company can learn faster and have a structured approach to these
iterations.

For guidance on how to express our brand in writing and communication style, see
[Brand Personality, Tone of Voice & Character](/handbook/marketing/brand-voice/)

Please also read the
[Company Mission](/handbook/company/strategy/#flowfuse%27s-mission) before
diving into the messaging.

## Selection Criteria - Key Messaging 

This captures how we believe an ICP team is thinking about how to choose their next generation software platform for digitalizing their industrial process. This captures the following questions and our answers.

These are the 11 FlowFuse Messaging Commandments. 
Every message that comes out from the team has to stick to one or many of these commandments. Otherwise it is wrong, because it’s not really helping sales. 

1) Can I connect to any machines in my industrial process and collect data
- Node-RED supports 5,000 plugs-ins for collecting data
- FlowFuse enables scalable agent deployment to unify data from diverse sources and protocols across industrial edge devices
2) Can I transport data across any protocol
- Connect separate systems and industrial protocols with a unified platform for real-time data flow
   · You can connect disparate systems and industrial protocols with a unified platform. Our low-code environment, accelerated by an AI Copilot, makes it faster than ever to build the logic for real-time data flow between any source and destination.
3) Can I easily tag and store data I am collecting in any data platform
- Transform raw data into a structured and unified information model with low-code data transformation tools
   · Transform raw data into a structured and unified information model with our AI-assisted low-code tools. Simply describe the data transformation you need in plain English, and our platform will help generate the necessary logic, from SQL queries to JavaScript functions.
4) Can I build a new application quickly without needing software developers
- Bridge the gap between IT and OT teams enabling domain experts to build solutions while maintaining IT oversight
   · We bridge the gap between IT and OT, enabling domain experts to build solutions while maintaining IT oversight. Our AI Copilot acts as a development partner, empowering your team to build more sophisticated applications independently, reducing reliance on specialized developers.
5) Is it easy to build interactive dashboards
- Create custom dashboards and applications to monitor KPIs, optimize production, and adapt quickly to new business requirements
   · Create custom dashboards and applications to monitor KPIs and optimize production. Our AI assistant helps you build these visualizations faster by generating the necessary code for custom UI components based on your descriptions.
6) Can I version control, update and deploy applications across my environment
- Deploy standardized applications across multiple facilities with centralized version control and remote management
- Scale from pilot projects to organization-wide digital initiatives with consistent governance and security policies
   · Our platform even uses AI to automatically summarize the changes between versions, making it easier to track updates and maintain control.
7) Does the application system come with a security framework
- Built-in monitoring, audit trails, and role-based access controls ensure production-ready deployments at scale
8) Does the system have any pre-built applications that model my processes
- Comprehensive solutions including IT/OT Middleware, Unified Namespace, SCADA, MES, and Edge Connectivity modules
   · Yes, we offer comprehensive solution blueprints including IT/OT Middleware, Unified Namespace (UNS), SCADA, and MES. These blueprints provide a powerful starting point, and our AI Copilot helps you customize and extend them to fit your exact needs in record time.
9) How long can I use this tech stack before it becomes obsolete and can I trust it
- The underpinning technology of FlowFuse is Node-RED, a large and self-sustaining open source community under the OpenJS Foundation.
- Built on Node-RED open-source foundation with enterprise-grade reliability, high availability, and automated backups
   · FlowFuse builds on this with enterprise-grade reliability, high availability, and automated backups. Furthermore, we are constantly innovating, evolving the platform with cutting-edge capabilities like our AI Copilot to ensure your investment is future-proof.
10) Does the platform include AI assistance to accelerate application development and reduce technical barriers?
- AI-Assisted Node-RED with Smart Suggestions offers intelligent flow completion for next-node recommendations
11) Can I access enterprise-grade, professionally maintained integrations and custom components?
- FlowFuse Certified Nodes v2.0 partners with developers who demonstrate deep expertise in their domains, focusing on reliability, security, and professional implementation standards

## Audience

FlowFuse is a business to business (B2B) company in the industrial markets to
innovate with software through low-code development. The end user is a skilled
worker, but not always skilled in automation through software.

FlowFuse often sells to IT teams that want to enable the OT teams to participate
in digital solution building.

FlowFuse focusses on the engineer for messaging, this is due to the adoption of
our software being grass-roots.

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

FlowFuse appeals to a broad range of customers, many of which do not fall into
our 'ICP'. That's not to say FlowFuse shouldn't cater to this audience, but does

1. Manufacturing or industrial company
   1. Tier 1: Automotive, Pharma, Renewable energy
   1. Tier 2: Electronics, Semiconductor, Chemical, Oil & Gas
   1. Tier 3: Food & Beverage, Mining, Water & Wastewater
1. Greater than $500 million in annual revenue. The need to have sufficiently
   large budgets to purchase FlowFuse.
1. Greater than 500 employees. The company needs to be large enough to have
   internal IT and/or OT people on staff.
1. Node-RED interested
1. Established Digitalization strategy

[our market](/handbook/company/strategy/#the-market).

### Prospect Stages (Node-RED Awareness)

When considering messaging, sales conversations and how we communicate our value
as a product and company, wan important factor for us at this stage is how aware
of Node-RED the prospect/customer is.

We classify a customer into one of five "stages":

- **Stage 0: Unaware of Node-RED** No knowledge of Node-RED and what is does
- **Stage 1: Node-RED Discovery** Aware of what Node-RED is, and may have
  dabbled with it a little, without using it in-depth
- **Stage 2: Value of Node-RED** User has used Node-RED in their own personal
  projects, or for professional proof-of-concepts
- **Stage 3: Node-RED in Production** Person has built and deployed Node-RED in
  a professional, production, environment
- **Stage 4: Node-RED at Scale** User has over 5 x Node-RED instances running in
  a production environment

Independent of the stage a customer is at, we need to ensure we have consistent
messaging around the value of FlowFuse, but be aware of other value (e.g. the
pure value of Node-RED) which can still be factored into the conversation.
