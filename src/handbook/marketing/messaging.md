# {{ navTitle }}

Clear and consistent messaging serves as a cornerstone for our company to
achieve growth and a bigger market presence. The messaging framework is
essential for the company to communicate its value, purpose, and
differentiation, to in turn effectively acquire and retain our customer base.

Consistency of messaging is important; with our growing company we’ve got
limited resources and thus it’s imperative to make a significant impact quickly.
If that fails, the company must learn quickly and iterate. When the messaging is
consistent the company can learn faster and have a structured approach to these
iterations.

For guidance on how to express our brand in writing and communication style, see
[Brand Personality, Tone of Voice & Character](/handbook/marketing/brand-voice/)

Please also read the
[Company Mission](/handbook/company/strategy/#flowfuse%27s-mission) before
diving into the messaging.

## Audience

FlowFuse is a business to business (B2B) company in the industrial markets to
innovate with software through low-code development. The end user is a skilled
worker, but not always skilled in automation through software.

FlowFuse often sells to IT teams that want to enable the OT teams to participate
in digital solution building.

FlowFuse focusses on the engineer for messaging, this is due to the adoption of
our software being grass-roots.

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

FlowFuse appeals to a broad range of customers, many of which do not fall into
our 'ICP'. That's not to say FlowFuse shouldn't cater to this audience, but does

1. Manufacturing or industrial company
   1. Tier 1: Automotive, Pharma, Renewable energy
   1. Tier 2: Electronics, Semiconductor, Chemical, Oil & Gas
   1. Tier 3: Food & Beverage, Mining, Water & Wastewater
1. Greater than $500 million in annual revenue. The need to have sufficiently
   large budgets to purchase FlowFuse.
1. Greater than 500 employees. The company needs to be large enough to have
   internal IT and/or OT people on staff.
1. Node-RED interested
1. Established Digitalization strategy

### Prospect Stages (Node-RED Awareness)

When considering messaging, sales conversations and how we communicate our value
as a product and company, wan important factor for us at this stage is how aware
of Node-RED the prospect/customer is.

We classify a customer into one of five "stages":

- **Stage 0: Unaware of Node-RED** No knowledge of Node-RED and what is does
- **Stage 1: Node-RED Discovery** Aware of what Node-RED is, and may have
  dabbled with it a little, without using it in-depth
- **Stage 2: Value of Node-RED** User has used Node-RED in their own personal
  projects, or for professional proof-of-concepts
- **Stage 3: Node-RED in Production** Person has built and deployed Node-RED in
  a professional, production, environment
- **Stage 4: Node-RED at Scale** User has over 5 x Node-RED instances running in
  a production environment

Independent of the stage a customer is at, we need to ensure we have consistent
messaging around the value of FlowFuse, but be aware of other value (e.g. the
pure value of Node-RED) which can still be factored into the conversation.

## FlowFuse in-depth

FlowFuse is the industrial-grade platform designed to empower teams building and managing applications on Node-RED at scale. Founded in 2021 by [Nick O'Leary](/team#nick-oleary), the co-creator of Node-RED, FlowFuse extends and enhances the open-source Node-RED environment that revolutionized low-code programming for data integration and automation.
While Node-RED is widely recognized for its flexibility and ease of use in wiring together diverse systems and data streams, its original design wasn’t built for complex industrial scale or enterprise governance. FlowFuse addresses these gaps by providing an advanced, secure, and scalable framework that industrial teams need to confidently deploy and operate mission-critical applications.
