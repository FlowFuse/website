navTitle: Brand Voice

# Brand Personality, Tone of Voice & Character

## Why This Matters

The brand personality and tone of voice reflect who we are as a company — not just in what we say, but in how we say it. Defining these attributes ensures that all internal and external communication is aligned, consistent, and memorable. This foundation helps FlowFuse build trust, foster engagement, and stand apart in the industrial and low-code software landscape.

Our tone of voice should also embody the [company values](/handbook/company/values/) — from customer empathy and constructive candor to iterative improvement and delivering results.


## Brand Personality

Our brand should feel like a trusted partner for industrial engineers and developers navigating digital transformation. We stand for empowerment, transparency, and progressive thinking — always grounded in practical reality.

| Trait              | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Reliable**        | Like a well-designed system, we are dependable and consistent. |
| **Approachable & Close** | We speak plainly and treat people with empathy, respect, and inclusion — no matter their role or experience level. |
| **Innovative**      | We are always moving forward and encouraging users to do the same. |
| **Pragmatic**       | Grounded in real-world use cases and needs, not buzzwords. |
| **Community-minded** | We believe in open-source, shared learning, and mutual success. |

| **Candid & Constructive** | We give honest, helpful feedback and appreciate the same in return. |

We are the engineer’s enabler — technical enough to be respected, accessible enough to be adopted.


## Tone of Voice

FlowFuse communicates in a tone that reflects clarity, competence, and collaboration. Our audience is highly technical, but often stretched for time or new to low-code development. We want to make their experience as easy and empowering as possible.

**Our tone is:**

- ✅ **Straightforward** — No jargon for the sake of it. We explain things simply and get to the point.
- ✅ **Helpful** — We speak like an expert colleague who wants to make your work easier.
- ✅ **Confident but humble** — We know our value, but never talk down to users.
- ✅ **Optimistic** — Our tone encourages innovation, without hype.
- ✅ **Precise** — Industrial solutions require accuracy. We avoid fluff.
- ✅ **Close and human** — We sound like real people. Friendly and respectful, never robotic or distant.

**Our tone is *not*:**

- ❌ **Overly** casual ("Yo, wazzup!") or humorous
- ❌ Marketing-speak (“synergy”, “transformative”, “next-gen”)  
- ❌ Boastful or arrogant  
- ❌ Ambiguous or vague  
- ❌ Cold or corporate  


## The FlowFuse “Character”

If FlowFuse were a person, it would be:

> **A smart, hands-on engineer who builds practical solutions — and helps others do the same. They understand complex systems, but don’t overcomplicate. They’re calm under pressure, solution-focused, and enjoy solving real problems with real tools. They’re approachable, transparent, and always willing to lend a hand.**

This “character” comes through in everything we do: product design, documentation, social media, sales calls, webinars, support, and community interactions.


## How to Apply This

Whether writing an email, blog post, tweet, UI message, or sales pitch:

- **Lead with clarity.** Avoid intros that bury the point. Say what matters, early.
- **Support with value.** Back up claims with real features, use cases, or customer wins.
- **Reflect empathy.** Know your audience’s context and pain points.
- **Use consistent terminology.** Refer to our features, solutions, and mission the same way across channels.
- **Avoid filler.** If a sentence doesn’t help communicate value, cut it.
- **Sound human.** Write like someone who’s been in the room — and understands.

## Terminology & Style Guidelines

### Node-RED

Node-RED should always be written with a hyphen and this specific capitalization: **Node-RED**. Never "node-red", "NodeRED", or "Node Red". This applies everywhere where applicable, especially in external communications: documentation, blog posts, social media, and emails.

## Examples of Tone in Action

**✅ Aligned Example:**

> “Connect your PLCs, Raspberry Pis, and dashboards — all in one place. FlowFuse makes it easy to build, deploy, and monitor Node-RED applications at scale.”

**❌ Not Aligned Example:**

> “Unlock the power of cutting-edge automation with our revolutionary, industry-defining platform. The future of IIoT starts here!”

## Context Matters: Adapting the Voice, Not the Values

Just like people adjust how they speak depending on where they are, our brand voice should adapt depending on the context — without ever losing its core personality.

FlowFuse always sounds like the same person, but that person knows how to read the room.

### Owned channels (e.g. newsletter, LinkedIn, blog)

In these spaces, people follow us because they want to hear from us. It’s okay to be a little more promotional or curated. These are good places to:

- Share product news, updates, and wins
- Use slightly more polished or brand-focused language
- Highlight what makes FlowFuse special
- Speak on behalf of the company voice

Tone can be:
- Professional, but warm
- Informative, confident
- Occasionally light, if appropriate

**Example:**  
> FlowFuse 3.0 is live — and brings dashboarding for Node-RED to a whole new level. See what’s new and what it means for your team.


### Participating in community spaces (e.g. Node-RED forum, GitHub, Discord)

When FlowFuse team members engage from personal accounts, they bring their own voice — but still represent the values of the company.

Tone should be:
- Friendly, humble, and helpful
- Empathetic and patient
- Focused on offering value

**Example:**  
> Hey, good question! I’ve seen a similar issue when deploying on Docker — it might be worth checking your volume permissions. Let me know if that helps or if you want to try another approach.

For broader principles on interacting with the community as a FlowFuse team member, see our [Community Guidelines](/handbook/marketing/community/community-guidelines.md).

### Commenting on third-party content (e.g. posts by others)

Whether responding from our company profile or a personal one, the focus here should be adding value to the conversation. Less “selling”, more listening, supporting, and acknowledging.

Tone should be:
- Respectful and considered
- Informed, but not promotional
- Open to dialogue

**Example:**  
> This is a great point about deployment at scale. We've seen similar needs from our users — especially when managing mixed environments. Curious how you're handling OTA updates?

Our voice flexes with the context, but never breaks character.  
We stay approachable, helpful, and professional — everywhere we show up.


This section should evolve as our brand evolves. Keep it close when creating content or communicating with prospects. Consistency builds trust, and personality builds connection.
