## About FlowFuse - 150 Words

FlowFuse is an open-core company investing in Node-RED. Nick Oâ€™Leary, co-creator of Node-RED is FlowFuse co-founder and CTO. 

Node-RED is an open-source low-code programming tool, allowing developers to quickly and easily connect IoT devices, APIs, and online services by creating flow-based applications. It uses a drag-and-drop interface to wire together nodes, which can represent devices, APIs, or functions, to process data, and create powerful automations. 

Node-RED is very popular in the manufacturing industry for collecting factory data at the edge and transmitting it to a database or the cloud. Its visual programming environment makes it easy for non-traditional software developers to create custom applications that accelerate innovation on the factory floor.

FlowFuse and Node-RED makes it possible for manufacturing companies to build bespoke, flexible, and resilient applications that solve a business problem and drive forward transformation.
