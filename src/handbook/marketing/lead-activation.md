# Lead Activation

This page defines how FlowFuse categorizes and activates leads for the sales
process. Understanding these definitions ensures alignment between marketing and
sales on lead sources and qualification criteria.

## Activation Categories

### Inbound (Pull)

Prospects who actively express interest in FlowFuse through self-service actions.

For example:
- Form submissions on the website
- Opt-ins and hand raises
- Contact sales requests
- Gated content downloads
- Webinar registrations

These leads have shown an interest and are ready for direct sales follow-up
based on their qualification level.

### Outbound (Push)

Prospects contacted proactively by FlowFuse without prior hand raising. Outbound
leads are further categorized into three sub-types based on the strength of the signal:

#### Intent Outbound (Push Based on Behavior)

Prospects showing behavioral signals of interest without explicit hand raise.

For example
- Website visits tracked via intent tools (Hubspot Intent, Warmly)
- Ad interaction data from platforms like ZenABM
- Content engagement patterns
- Product page visits
- Pricing page views

Engage based on their intent signals, lead with relevant content or use cases
aligned to their browsing behavior.

#### Warm Outbound (Push Based on Relationship)

Prospects with existing relationship or prior interaction history.

For example:
- Previous conversations or meetings
- Referrals from existing customers or partners
- Past event attendees
- Former trial users who didn't convert
- Contacts from partner organizations

Reference the existing relationship or prior interaction to re-engage the
conversation.

#### Cold Outbound (Push Based on Fit)

Prospects contacted solely based on contextual fit (being an ICP)
without prior signal or relationship.

For example:
- No hand raise or opt-in
- No behavioral intent signals
- No prior relationship or interaction
- Matches ICP criteria (industry, company size, role, etc.)

Lead with education and our value proposition, focusing on pain points common to
their ICP segment.

## Tracking in HubSpot

The `Activation Outbound` property in HubSpot is set to `Yes` when the first
meeting with a contact originated from any outbound category (Intent, Warm, or
Cold). This includes contacts who may have been in HubSpot through marketing
activities but were not yet nurtured to the point of a meeting.
