# Marketing Videos

This section of our handbook is dedicated to guidance on how to create video/media assets for FlowFuse. Here you can find information on what types of videos we produce at FlowFuse and the templating and formatting we recommend for each. 

Videos should be produced at 1920 x 1080 resolution. 

Any text included in the videos will use the ["DIN Alternate Bold"](https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/DIN-Alternate-Bold) font. The FlowFuse logo is made with ["Baloo Da 2"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baloo+Da+2).

We have a collection of [assets](#assets) that will make video editing and creation a lot simpler, particularly in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## Assets

If you have an Adobe Creative Cloud account, and are a member of the FlowFuse team, then you will have access to the "FlowFuse Templates" library in Premiere Pro. This contains a collection of [Essential Graphics templates](https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/premiere-pro/using/essential-graphics-panel.html), videos and audio files that can be used across any FlowFuse videos.

### Essential Graphics Templates

These can be created in Adobe After Effects and provide an easy-to-use editable template for composition in Premiere Pro. We have a growing collection of FlowFuse templates that can be dropped and modified accordingly in your own FlowFuse videos.

### Videos

Re-usable `.mp4` files that may be used across FlowFuse videos. These are also available in "FlowFuse Templates" Premiere Pro Library. If you don't have access to the library and need the `.mp4` files to use them in a different software, you can find them in the [Video assets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QcVSXPs2Rip2vi6S8BrmZAwp9TLAVsrw?usp=drive_link) folder from our shared Drive. 

## Tools

If you require a license to one of the following tools (where applicable), then please read our [licensing](/handbook/peopleops/expenses#software-licenses) section in order to attain one.

### Adobe Creative Cloud ([more info](https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud.html))

#### Video Editing

- **After Effects** enables the generation of videos and provides control of individual animated elements within a composition. Use this if you're looking to generate bespoke animations to use in your videos.

- **Premiere Pro** - Use this when piecing together multiple bits of footage and existing FlowFuse templates. Premiere Pro is better for stitching existing compositions, for example, the opening/closing FlowFuse title sequences, either side of some demo footage.

### Image Editing

- **Illustrator** provides tooling to create templates that can ingested into After Effects. It's often easier to layout complex content in Illustrator, [then export to After Effects for animation](https://www.schoolofmotion.com/blog/import-adobe-illustrator-files-into-after-effects).

- **Photoshop** can be used for raster image and photo-editing.

## Video Types

### User Journey Videos

These are product marketing videos explaining what value FlowFuse provides going
through a user journey. These videos have a very fixed structure [with templates listed]:

1. FlowFuse Intro _[Template: /Bookends/Intro]_
2. Explain the problem a user might be facing before the user journey
3. Walk, don't run, through the user journey explaining _why_ each step must be taken
3. Explain what was achieved
4. FlowFuse Outro Ident _[Template: /Bookends/Outro]_

#### Recording Demos for Release Videos

Screen recordings used within the Release Videos should be recorded at 1800 x 1080 in order to fit within the reusable template. The border size can be easily adjusted though if required.

In our "FlowFuse Templates" Adobe Premiere Pro library we have three "UI Preview" templates available at different lengths (10, 13 and 15 seconds). It is recommended to edit the recordings in a piece of software of your choice down to your chosen timing, as this will make use of the templates a lot easier.

### Marketing Videos

Much more creative license and freedom in terms of content and approach. If we are using iconography and pictograms, then they should be stylized and animated as per our [branding guidelines](/handbook/design/branding.md).
