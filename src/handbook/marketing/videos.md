# Marketing Videos

This section of our handbook is dedicated to guidance on how to create video/media assets for FlowFuse. Here you can find information on what types of videos we produce at FlowFuse and the templating and formatting we recommend for each. 

Videos should be produced at 1920 x 1080 resolution. 

Any text included in the videos will use the ["DIN Alternate Bold"](https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/DIN-Alternate-Bold) font. The FlowFuse logo is made with ["Baloo Da 2"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baloo+Da+2).

We have a collection of [assets](#assets) that will make video editing and creation a lot simpler, particularly in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## Assets

If you have an Adobe Creative Cloud account, and are a member of the FlowFuse team, then you will have access to the "FlowFuse Templates" library in Premiere Pro. This contains a collection of [Essential Graphics templates](https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/premiere-pro/using/essential-graphics-panel.html), videos and audio files that can be used across any FlowFuse videos.

### Essential Graphics Templates

These can be created in Adobe After Effects and provide an easy-to-use editable template for composition in Premiere Pro. We have a growing collection of FlowFuse templates that can be dropped and modified accordingly in your own FlowFuse videos.

### Videos

Re-usable `.mp4` files that may be used across FlowFuse videos. These are also available in "FlowFuse Templates" Premiere Pro Library. If you don't have access to the library and need the `.mp4` files to use them in a different software, you can find them in the [Video assets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QcVSXPs2Rip2vi6S8BrmZAwp9TLAVsrw?usp=drive_link) folder from our shared Drive. 

## Tools

If you require a license to one of the following tools (where applicable), then please read our [licensing](/handbook/peopleops/expenses#software-licenses) section in order to attain one.

### Adobe Creative Cloud ([more info](https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud.html))

#### Video Editing

- **After Effects** enables the generation of videos and provides control of individual animated elements within a composition. Use this if you're looking to generate bespoke animations to use in your videos.

- **Premiere Pro** - Use this when piecing together multiple bits of footage and existing FlowFuse templates. Premiere Pro is better for stitching existing compositions, for example, the opening/closing FlowFuse title sequences, either side of some demo footage.

### Image Editing

- **Illustrator** provides tooling to create templates that can ingested into After Effects. It's often easier to layout complex content in Illustrator, [then export to After Effects for animation](https://www.schoolofmotion.com/blog/import-adobe-illustrator-files-into-after-effects).

- **Photoshop** can be used for raster image and photo-editing.

## Video Types

### User Journey Videos

These are product marketing videos explaining what value FlowFuse provides going
through a user journey. These videos have a very fixed structure [with templates listed]:

1. FlowFuse Intro _[Template: /Bookends/Intro]_
2. Explain the problem a user might be facing before the user journey
3. Walk, don't run, through the user journey explaining _why_ each step must be taken
3. Explain what was achieved
4. FlowFuse Outro Ident _[Template: /Bookends/Outro]_

#### Recording Demos for Release Videos

Screen recordings used within the Release Videos should be recorded at 1800 x 1080 in order to fit within the reusable template. The border size can be easily adjusted though if required.

In our "FlowFuse Templates" Adobe Premiere Pro library we have three "UI Preview" templates available at different lengths (10, 13 and 15 seconds). It is recommended to edit the recordings in a piece of software of your choice down to your chosen timing, as this will make use of the templates a lot easier.

### Marketing Videos

Much more creative license and freedom in terms of content and approach. If we are using iconography and pictograms, then they should be stylized and animated as per our [branding guidelines](/handbook/design/branding.md).

## Developer Relations Content

Developer Relations content is developed principally for three audiences:

* Core consumers, e.g. those who already use FlowFuse and want to be informed, educated, or entertained;
* New consumers, e.g. those who are unfamiliar with FlowFuse and want to understand what it can offer or what it does differently; and
* Lapsed consumers, e.g. those who are familiar with FlowFuse or Node-RED but have not stayed up to date with news or product evolutions.

Accordingly, content should always be planned around answering a question or advocating an offering. This content is then synchronised across a few different channels to ensure wide engagement opportunity.

### Tools

While Developer Relations production should leverage common tools and processes, native content creation for each Advocate can originate in different ways. This area documents how each Developer Relations Advocate generates and edits content.

#### Kristopher Sandoval

Kristopher uses the following tools for content generation and editing.

##### Filming

- Content is filmed on an iPhone 17 Pro Max in 120FPS at 4K.
- Key lights: 2 LED panels (2800-6500K) at a 45° angle to the subject.
- Ambient lights: 2 P96L SMallRig LED lights (2500-8000K) behind the subject.
- Fill lights: Govee RGBIC (2700k-6500k) at a 22.5° angle to the projection surface.
- Primary audio: DJI Mic Mini (2 TX + 1 RX).
- Prompter: Elgato Prompter.
  
##### Editing

- DaVinci Resolve with exports to convertible formats for Premiere Pro and After Effects.
- Music, SFX, and Foley from [Epidemic Sound](https://www.epidemicsound.com/).
- Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve Speed Editor for rapid editing.

### Content Production

For our Developer Relations content, we align behind production best standards. This means that we have three phases of production - pre-production, production, and post-production, each with their own steps and processes.

#### Pre-Production Phase

In this phase of production, we generate scripts, review content for accuracy, and validate fit and function of the content piece. Whenever possible, we aim for a 24 hour review cycle for scripts, meaning that content should be reviewed by stakeholders with at least a 24 hour lead-time for production.

#### Production Phase

In this phase, content is filmed. Whenever possible, we default to 4k at either 60FPS or 120FPS, and generate either .mp4 or .mov containers in HEVC or H.264 codecs. When filming content, try as best as you can to ensure audio is free of echo, reverb, bass resonance, and other audio artifacts. When this cannot be done, try to capture audio as close to the source as possible.

#### Post-Production

During this phase, video content is edited, mixed, and finalised. The specific flow is down to each editor and production, but the following best practises are advised:

* Audio should be filtered and cleaned up. In editors like Davinci, you may have an AI isolation option - please use these techniques to reduce room noise, but balance it with natural sound and EQ to make sure that the audio is not overly compressed or otherwise fatigueing for the listener.
* Solutions like Adobe podcast can be used to clean up audio from noisy sources - but as with AI isolation, make sure you use it sparingly to not overwhelm the listener with artifacting or over-compression.
* Video edits should be professional and focused on the content at hand. Jump cuts are fine, but should be used only to emphasise a point or to cleanly transition between video - it should not be frentic or distracting.
* Video effects can be applied, but again, sparingly. Try not to be too visually loud or over-stimulating - Developer Relations content is somewhere between educational and entertainment, but we're not trying to go for frentic YouTube here.

### Uploading Content

Content is uploaded via the native YouTube upload manager. This manager requires some specific content and settings for each video uploaded as detailed in the following sections.

#### Details

These are the core details for every video release.

##### Title

The title must be representative of the content in the video itself - YouTube's algorithm can punish content whose title does not match the content of the video. Ensure that the title also contains three hashtags - any more than this will be ignored by YouTube. The hastags must also be relevant to the content - avoid overly general hashtags and ensure that they are relevant to the content of the video itself.

##### Description

The description should contain similar copy to the social posts made to promote the video, and should provide the viewer with an expectation of what they're going to learn from the video. At the end of the description, include a "Links" section such as this:

`````
Links:
- FlowFuse's Free 14 Day Trial (https://flowfuse.com/)
- Contact the FlowFuse Team (https://flowfuse.com/contact-us/)
- FMES: What It Is and Why You Need It for Your Factory (https://flowfuse.com/blog/2025/06/what-is-mes/)
- MES Blueprints (https://flowfuse.com/blueprints/)
- Kristopher Sandoval (https://youtube.com/@kristopherleads)
`````

This will allow the viewer to follow through on specific calls to action throughout the video, and will also help generate social collateral for the speaker and for FlowFuse content.

Following this, add another batch of hashtags. Include the first three from the title, and consider another 1-2 for additional relevance if justified.

##### Thumbnail

Provide a thumbnail for the video. Try to keep the title and any featured content simple, relatively high-contrast, and minimal. The idea here is to give an immediate preview of what is going to be talked about - not to engage in "clickbait" or catch someone's eye with extremely large or garish text.

##### Playlists

For all new DevRel content, ensure that you are adding the video to the "FlowFuse" playlist. This will make sure that it features in the Home tab of the YouTube channel. For non-DevRel content that is nonetheless produced through this process - e.g. advertisements, memes, etc. - ensure you are adding it to a Playlist for ease of navigation.

##### Audience

There are two questions you must answer here. For the top section, ensure that you have checked "No, it's not made for kids". For the bottom section, ensure you have selected "No, don't restrict my video to viewers over 18 only".

##### Altered content

Ensure that you select "No" in response to this section to mark the content as not AI-generated. If you are featuring content which is principally AI-generated, this section should be marked "Yes". This question has an impact on distribution and is a core YouTube policy, so make sure that you pay attention to this question.

##### Collaboration

YouTube allows you to connect a video with a collaborator - for instance, content created by Kristopher Sandoval is linked to https://www.youtube.com/@kristopherleads. The benefit of doing this is that the video will show to both audiences, leveraging both the collaborator audience algorithm as well as the core channel algorithm. If the creator of the video has a YouTube channel, ensure that you add them in this section. This will generate a link which must be shared with the collaborator, who will open the link in their own YouTube studio instance to accept.

##### Tags

Add up to 500 characters worth of tags. This section has minimal impact in video reach, but they help clarify specific terms, matched audience interests, etc. Always add FlowFuse and Node-RED - but also consider adding things like "IT OT convergence", "AI integration", etc. to help audiences find this video.

##### Language and captions certification

Ensure that you have selected English as the "Video language" and the "Title and description language".

##### Category

This should default to our channel category, "Science & Technology". Ensure this is correct.

#### Video elements

This controls the appearance of elements inside each video natively in YouTube.

##### Add an end screen

Use this section to add an end screen. Click "Import from video", and in the tool, select "Import from video" again. Select the most recent DevRel video release. This should give you an automatic three-frame end screen with "Video: Most recent upload" on the left, the FlowFuse logo in the center, and "Video: best for viewer" on the right. Use the editor to ensure that each element appears at the right time in the video to show on the end card, then click "Save".

##### Add cards

If appropriate, you can use this tool to add promotional links in the video itself using the YouTube Cards feature. This is best used when you say something like "visit FlowFuse.com to read this blog", "there's a link to the blueprint in the description below", or other similar calls to action that could benefit from a direct link. This tool will require you provide a link, an action text, a preview text, and an image. Make sure your image is the FlowFuse square badge.

##### Visibility

When you first upload a video, make sure you have set the "Save or publish" section to Private. If you wish to share internally for review, you can set to Unlisted. At no point should you set Public unless you are actually releasing the video - this will push the video to all of our subscriber's video feeds. When releasing a video, if you can, use the Schedule tool. Select your date and time, and click "Set as Premiere" to create a landing page for viewers to bookmark.
