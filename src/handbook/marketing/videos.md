# Marketing Videos

This section of our handbook is dedicated to guidance on how to create video/media assets for FlowFuse. Here you can find information on what types of videos we produce at FlowFuse and the templating and formatting we recommend for each. 

Videos should be produced at 1920 x 1080 resolution. 

Any text included in the videos will use the ["DIN Alternate Bold"](https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/DIN-Alternate-Bold) font. The FlowFuse logo is made with ["Baloo Da 2"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baloo+Da+2).

We have a collection of [assets](#assets) that will make video editing and creation a lot simpler, particularly in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## Assets

If you have an Adobe Creative Cloud account, and are a member of the FlowFuse team, then you will have access to the "FlowFuse Templates" library in Premiere Pro. This contains a collection of [Essential Graphics templates](https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/premiere-pro/using/essential-graphics-panel.html), videos and audio files that can be used across any FlowFuse videos.

### Essential Graphics Templates

These can be created in Adobe After Effects and provide an easy-to-use editable template for composition in Premiere Pro. We have a growing collection of FlowFuse templates that can be dropped and modified accordingly in your own FlowFuse videos.

### Videos

Re-usable `.mp4` files that may be used across FlowFuse videos. These are also available in "FlowFuse Templates" Premiere Pro Library. If you don't have access to the library and need the `.mp4` files to use them in a different software, you can find them in the [Video assets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QcVSXPs2Rip2vi6S8BrmZAwp9TLAVsrw?usp=drive_link) folder from our shared Drive. 

## Tools

If you require a license to one of the following tools (where applicable), then please read our [licensing](/handbook/peopleops/expenses#software-licenses) section in order to attain one.

### Adobe Creative Cloud ([more info](https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud.html))

#### Video Editing

- **After Effects** enables the generation of videos and provides control of individual animated elements within a composition. Use this if you're looking to generate bespoke animations to use in your videos.

- **Premiere Pro** - Use this when piecing together multiple bits of footage and existing FlowFuse templates. Premiere Pro is better for stitching existing compositions, for example, the opening/closing FlowFuse title sequences, either side of some demo footage.

### Image Editing

- **Illustrator** provides tooling to create templates that can ingested into After Effects. It's often easier to layout complex content in Illustrator, [then export to After Effects for animation](https://www.schoolofmotion.com/blog/import-adobe-illustrator-files-into-after-effects).

- **Photoshop** can be used for raster image and photo-editing.

## Video Types

### User Journey Videos

These are product marketing videos explaining what value FlowFuse provides going
through a user journey. These videos have a very fixed structure [with templates listed]:

1. FlowFuse Intro _[Template: /Bookends/Intro]_
2. Explain the problem a user might be facing before the user journey
3. Walk, don't run, through the user journey explaining _why_ each step must be taken
3. Explain what was achieved
4. FlowFuse Outro Ident _[Template: /Bookends/Outro]_

#### Recording Demos for Release Videos

Screen recordings used within the Release Videos should be recorded at 1800 x 1080 in order to fit within the reusable template. The border size can be easily adjusted though if required.

In our "FlowFuse Templates" Adobe Premiere Pro library we have three "UI Preview" templates available at different lengths (10, 13 and 15 seconds). It is recommended to edit the recordings in a piece of software of your choice down to your chosen timing, as this will make use of the templates a lot easier.

### Marketing Videos

Much more creative license and freedom in terms of content and approach. If we are using iconography and pictograms, then they should be stylized and animated as per our [branding guidelines](/handbook/design/branding.md).

## Content Production
For our Developer Relations content, we align behind production best standards. This means that we have three phases of production - pre-production, production, and post-production, each with their own steps and processes.
### Pre-Production Phase
In this phase of production, we generate scripts, review content for accuracy, and validate fit and function of the content piece. Whenever possible, we aim for a 24 hour review cycle for scripts, meaning that content should be reviewed by stakeholders with at least a 24 hour lead-time for production.
### Production Phase
In this phase, content is filmed. Whenever possible, we default to 4k at either 60FPS or 120FPS, and generate either .mp4 or .mov containers in HEVC or H.264 codecs. When filming content, try as best as you can to ensure audio is free of echo, reverb, bass resonance, and other audio artifacts. When this cannot be done, try to capture audio as close to the source as possible.
### Post-Production
During this phase, video content is edited, mixed, and finalised. The specific flow is down to each editor and production, but the following best practises are advised:

* Audio should be filtered and cleaned up. In editors like Davinci, you may have an AI isolation option - please use these techniques to reduce room noise, but balance it with natural sound and EQ to make sure that the audio is not overly compressed or otherwise fatigueing for the listener.
* Solutions like Adobe podcast can be used to clean up audio from noisy sources - but as with AI isolation, make sure you use it sparingly to not overwhelm the listener with artifacting or over-compression.
* Video edits should be professional and focused on the content at hand. Jump cuts are fine, but should be used only to emphasise a point or to cleanly transition between video - it should not be frentic or distracting.
* Video effects can be applied, but again, sparingly. Try not to be too visually loud or over-stimulating - Developer Relations content is somewhere between educational and entertainment, but we're not trying to go for frentic YouTube here.
