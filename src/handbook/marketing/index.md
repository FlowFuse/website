# Marketing department

## What we do

We're the team that promotes our company and product of FlowFuse to the core audience
of FlowFuse. This includes:
1. Generating brand awareness.
1. Publishing high-quality content such as blog posts, video, and infographics.
1. Engaging with the Node-RED and nascent FlowFuse communities
1. Event planning, such as [trade shows](/handbook/marketing/tradeshow/)
1. Growth hacking; always be innovating when finding the audience and engaging with
them in a cost effective way.

The ultimate goal for the department is to generate sales pipeline for the
sales team or sign ups for [FlowFuse Cloud](https://app.flowfuse.com).

### Marketing KPI

Our North Star metric is pipeline generated, which aligns with the ultimate goal for the department stated above. This North Star is supported by key input metrics that we track and measure:

- FFC trial signups
- [Contact Sales form completions](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/submissions/26586079/form/734455e5-4cda-4329-97da-07e40cda791c/performance/)
- [Unique website visitors](https://eu.posthog.com/project/2209/insights/PXeb0YSF)

Each of these metrics is reported on weekly during our Marketing Team Meeting to ensure we're tracking progress toward our North Star.
