# Lead Generation

Lead generation helps expand FlowFuse's user base and drive revenue. By providing useful content, you can convert website visitors to leads for nurturing. Leads also provide a focused audience for marketing efforts, allowing for more effective communication and conversion strategies. Lead generation content includes whitepapers, ebooks, webinar slides, guides etc.

For definitions of inbound vs. outbound lead sources and the MQL activation process, see [Lead Activation](/handbook/marketing/lead-activation/). 

## Setting up

 - Once the content has been finalized, create a PDF version and upload it to Hubspot (Library -> files).
 - Create a new Form to capture lead information such as name, email, company and title. Add a campaign where relevant. (You can clone an existing form). Set the form submission action to link directly to the PDF or to a thank you page (thank you pages help track conversions in ad campaigns). 
 - Create a Thank you mail which includes the link to the PDf and request to "contact us" for further information/help.
 - Create a workflow to send the email upon form submission and to add the lead to a topic interest group list ([Example](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/workflows/26586079/platform/flow/1472559590/edit).   
 - Add the Form ID to the relevant Website page.
 - Add the Form to the [Content downloads list](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/contacts/26586079/objectLists/322/filters) and create a report for Form submissions for the [content performance dashboard](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/reports-dashboard/26586079/view/107434040) for tracking purposes.
