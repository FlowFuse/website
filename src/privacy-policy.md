# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of FlowFuse Inc (**“FlowFuse”**, **“we”**, **“us”** or **“our”**) and how we handle personal information that we collect through our digital properties that link to this Privacy Policy, including our website, (the **“Service”**), as well as through social media, our marketing activities, our events and other activities described in this policy.

At the time we collect personal information, we may provide additional or supplemental privacy notices to individuals for specific services and personal information processing activities.

Our Service is designed for businesses and their representatives. We do not offer products or services for use by individuals for their personal, family or household purposes. Accordingly, we treat all personal information we collect as pertaining to individuals in their capacities as business representatives and not their individual capacities.
