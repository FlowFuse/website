title: Device Management for Node-RED Deployments

heroImg: ./images/pictograms/factory.png
description:
    <p>Companies often deploy Node-RED out to monitor and collect data from edge devices (equipment, gateways, PLCs, etc.). How to manage these deployments for a large number of devices can be a challenge.  Luckily, FlowForge makes it possible to manage Node-RED deployments out to fleets of devices
    in a secure and reliable manner.</p>

                    FlowForge allows you to manage hundreds of devices that will all run the same Node-RED instance. The FlowForge device agent is deployed 
                    to each device to handle the synchronization of the future updates to the Node-RED instances. From a central console, you can now manage Node-RED
                    deployments in a reliable and repeatable process.</p>

                    Device provisioning credentials can be distributed to new devices to make provisioning and registering new devices as easy as possible.

                    FlowForge allows you to create Snapshots of your Node-RED flows that can then be deployed out to all your registered devices. From a central console, a single snapshot
                    can be deployed out to a group of devices. This gives you the peace of mind that all your devices are running the same version of your 
                    Node-RED flows.

                    <p>
                        The quick deployment of security updates or new versions for Node-RED is important for the overall security of your system. FlowForge's
                        device management capability makes it easy to re-host your Node-RED flows on a new version of Node-RED and then deploy it out to your devices.

                        If a production error occurs on a device, FlowForge allows for you to remotely debug the running Node-RED instance on the devices. This makes it much easier to identify and resolve production issues that might occur.
