                        Node-RED can be used to connect data from different types of hardware
                        and sensors used in manufacturing processes. This allows manufacturers
                        to gather and analyze data from different parts of the production line,
                        enabling them to make informed decisions and improve efficiency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Node-RED runs on a wide variety of PLC and IoT Edge Gateways. There
                        are also Node-RED nodes to collect data from different OT protocols,
                        including OPC-UA, Modbus, MQTT, S7, and more.

                    <p>
                        Node-RED allows manufacturers to integrate operational technology (OT)
                        and information technology (IT) data, creating a unified view of the
                        production process. Node-RED is ideal for integrating OT and IT data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the edge, Node-RED can pull down relevant data from different services,
                        ex. Weather information, for processing with OT data. Node-RED can also
                        send data to a database or the cloud for processing by IT services. This
                        integration helps manufacturers to make better use of the data they collect
                        and improve the overall efficiency of their operations.

                        Node-RED provides a visual interface for monitoring and analyzing
                        operational technology (OT) data in real-time.

                    <p>
                        It is simple to visualize manufacturing data in dashboards or simple
                        HMI making it easy for manufacturers to spot trends and anomalies,
                        and make data-driven decisions to improve their operations.

                    <p>
                        Node-RED can be used to automate event triggers based on certain
                        conditions or criteria. This enables manufacturers to respond to changes
                        in the production line in real-time, reducing downtime and improving efficiency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With Node-RED, manufacturers can create custom event trigger workflows
                        that can be easily modified and managed.
