    <p class="mt-0">Companies rely upon data from many different internal and external sources to provide a holistic view of the company and make informed decisions. However, data integration can be a challenging task, especially when dealing with multiple data formats, protocols, and sources.</p>
    <p>Node-RED’s low code development environment and extensive library of nodes makes it easy for anyone to collect data from different sources, take action on the data and update/store/transmit data to a new service</p>
