    content: "Legacy SCADA systems were built to monitor and control industrial systems before technological advancements provided a way to perform those functions without monolithic hardware systems. FlowFuse provides a complete SCADA solution on the foundation of Node-RED, enabling industrial control and monitoring at scale and with enterprise-grade security. Enjoy low-code, agile, and responsive development with a platform that will integrate with all future protocols."

    title: "How it Works"
    p1: "Built on Node-RED, FlowFuse uses open-source technology capable of quickly and securely building applications to connect, integrate, and control machines previously packaged as a standalone SCADA system."

    imageAlt1: "FlowFuse SCADA diagram"
    p2: "Let’s take an example. Your factory is using a Siemens S7 PLC and a Sentron, collecting data from various sensors and actuators. You want to manage the efficiency of this process, so you open the Node-RED instance that you created for managing this workflow and drag in the FlowFuse Certified S7 PLC node and Sentron node, entering configuration details to connect these devices along with anything else running in your factory."

    p3:
        - "After perfecting the flow to connect your devices needed for control, you add settings to send data from every important part of the process to a database. To save time creating actionable visualizations, you pull in one of the customizable dashboard Blueprints approved by FlowFuse. Because this entire process runs on Node-RED, each step is customizable and not limited to built-in parameters imposed by closed software. And because you’re using FlowFuse, the entire operation is secure and can scale to as many lines and sites as you need."
        - "The last step is to create useful visualizations. Since your team has been empowered to build the applications you need, you import some of your custom nodes and flows from your Team Library directly into your instance, structure your data the way you want to see it, and use FlowFuse Dashboard to create actionable visualizations. Because this entire process runs on Node-RED, each step is customizable and not limited to built-in parameters imposed by closed software. And because you’re using FlowFuse, the entire operation is secure and can scale to as many lines and sites as you need."
        - "No matter your SCADA setup, FlowFuse empowers your organization to securely control, connect, and operate your workflow the way you see fit."
