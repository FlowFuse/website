    faq:
        - question: "Can FlowFuse connect our PLCs to our ERP system?"
          answer: >
            Yes, FlowFuse supports virtually all industrial protocols through Node-RED's extensive ecosystem. Connect your Siemens, Allen-Bradley, Omron, or other PLCs directly to SAP, Oracle, or any ERP system.
        - question: "We have mixed equipment brands on our shop floor. Can FlowFuse handle this?"
          answer: >
            Absolutely. FlowFuse acts as a universal translator between different equipment brands and protocols, allowing seamless data exchange between Siemens, Rockwell, Schneider, and other vendors.
        - question: "How do we ensure production data security when connecting shop floor to business systems?"
          answer: >
            FlowFuse provides secure tunneling for device connections, encrypted data transmission using TLS/SSL, role-based access control (RBAC), and comprehensive audit logging to meet manufacturing compliance requirements.
        - question: "Can our plant operators create data flows without IT support?"
          answer: >
            Yes, FlowFuse uses a visual drag-and-drop interface. Operators can build integrations between machines, SCADA, and business systems by connecting pre-built nodes - no coding required.
        - question: "What if our legacy equipment doesn't support modern protocols?"
          answer: >
            FlowFuse can connect through serial converters, protocol gateways, or even manual data entry interfaces, ensuring no equipment is left behind in your digital transformation.
        - question: "Do we need to shut down production to implement FlowFuse?"
          answer: >
            No, FlowFuse can be deployed alongside existing systems with read-only connections initially. Full integration can be phased in during scheduled maintenance windows.
