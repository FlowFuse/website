# Logs

FlowForge presents log information in several different places depending on what you are interested in.

## Node-RED Logs

The Node-RED logs are available for all instances running within the platform.

They will contain information such as nodes being added and errors relating to your flows.

The log information is kept back to the last time the instance container was restarted, you can view older information on the `Load earlier...` link at the top of the log.
