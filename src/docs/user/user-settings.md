# User Settings

Access the FlowFuse User settings by clicking on your username in the top right corner.

## Settings

In the Settings section, you can modify various characteristics of your personal user account:

- **Username**
- **Name**
- **E-Mail** (modifiable only if SSO is disabled)

Additionally, you can select a default Team, especially useful if your account is associated with multiple Teams.

## Teams

The Teams tab provides an overview of all teams associated with your User account. Here, you can also view and respond to open invitations.

## Security

### Change Password

Under the Security section, you have the option to change your password. For this, you need to enter your current and new password.

### Two-Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account. It requires a second form of identification when logging in. Note that when signing in via your SSO provider, you will not be prompted for a two-factor authentication code.

To set up Two-factor authentication, click on `Enable two factor authentication` and follow the instructions.

### Access Tokens

Access Tokens are useful for interacting with [FlowFuse APIs](https://flowfuse.com/docs/api/). You can set these tokens to have a limited or unlimited lifespan. Tokens can be revoked at any time by removing them from your account. Remember, tokens with an expiry date will automatically delete upon reaching that date. It's important to note that the token value is only displayed once, at the time of creation. There is no way to retrieve the token value after this point.
