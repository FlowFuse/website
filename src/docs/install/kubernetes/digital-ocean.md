# Installing FlowForge on a Digital Ocean Kubernetes cluster

## Prerequisites

### Digital Ocean Account

You will need an active Digital Oceans Account, you can sign up
for an account [here](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new)

### Utilities

- kubectl - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/
- helm - https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

### DNS

You will need a domain that FlowForge will run on and access to configure
a wildcard entry for that domain in it's root DNS server.

In this guide I will use `example.com` as the domain, remember to substitute your domain.

## Create Cluster

- Click on the big green "Create" button at the top of the screen
- Select "Kubernetes" from the list
- Pick a suitable region (normally the one physically closest to you)
- Reduce the number of nodes from 3 to 2
- Reduce the "Node Plan" to 1GB Ram/2vCPU
- Change the cluster name to `k8s-flowforge`
- Hit "Create Cluster" button

When the cluster has finished provisioning you should be able to download
the `k8s-flowforge-kubeconfig.yml` file which will allow you to connect to the cluster.

## Install Ingress Controller

```bash
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
helm repo update
helm --kubeconfig=./k8s-flowforge-kubeconfig.yaml install nginx-ingress \
  ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --namespace ingress-nginx \
  --create-namespace \
  --set controller.publishService.enabled=true \
  --set controller.ingressClassResource.default=true \
  --wait

```

### Setup DNS

Run the following to get the external IP address of the Nginx Ingress 
Controller

```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig=./k8s-flowforge-kubeconfig.yaml \
  -n ingress-nginx get service nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller
```

You will need to update the entry in your DNS server to point 
`*.example.com` to the IP address listed under `EXTERNAL-IP`

## Install FlowForge

Then setup the FlowForge Helm repository

```bash
helm repo add flowforge https://flowforge.github.io/helm
helm repo update
```

Now create a `customizations.yml` file. This is how we configure the 
FlowForge instance.

The following is the bare minimum to get started:

```yaml
forge:
  domain: example.com
  https: false
  localPostgresql: true
  projectSelector: 
  managementSelector: 
  broker:
    enabled: true
```

Then we use this to install FlowForge

```bash
helm upgrade --install --kubeconfig ./k8s-flowforge-kubeconfig.yml \
  flowforge flowforge/flowforge -f customizations.yml \
  --wait
```

Once complete you should be able to sign into the FlowForge setup wizard 
at `http://forge.example.com`
