Previously, it was necessary to provide credit card details when transitioning from a trial to a subscription. Recognizing the diverse needs of businesses, we have now removed this requirement. You can now seamlessly switch to a subscription without the need to enter credit card details. We're committed to accommodating your specific billing preferences and can set up a process that aligns with your organizational needs.

If you are interested in this new option or have any questions, please don't hesitate to [contact us](https://flowfuse.com/contact-us/). We're here to help you with your billing and subscription needs.
