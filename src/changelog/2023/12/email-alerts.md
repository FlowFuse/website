The newly introduced feature offers email notifications tied to particular Auditlog events, available to all users with Team Tier access or higher. This feature is designed to facilitate immediate notification and action in response to significant occurrences, including incidents like a Node-RED Instance crash. For detailed information and guidance on this functionality, please refer to our [documentation](https://flowfuse.com/docs/user/instance-settings/#alerts).
