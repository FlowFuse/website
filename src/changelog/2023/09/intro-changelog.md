This is a changelog post. It is in `/src/changelog/2023/09/intro-changelog.md`.

It only has the `changelog` tag applied which means it doesn't appear in the main
blog.

It also means the full contents of the post is displayed in the changelog index, rather
than just a the summary.

Changelog posts do not show an image - removing the need to generate a thumbnail for
every new post. We will create a default thumbnail for changelog posts for when sharing
on socials.

Below you should see the recent post about the Dashboard release. This is cross-posted
from the main blog by adding the `changelog` tag to it. As a main post, which is expected
to be longer form, it only shows the summary.
