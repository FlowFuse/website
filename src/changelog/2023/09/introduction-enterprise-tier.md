We are excited to officially announce the implementation and introduction of our new Enterprise Tier. Starting today, all FlowFuse Cloud customers have the option to upgrade their tier directly through **Team Settings** -> **Danger** -> **Change Team Type**. For those who self-host FlowFuse, the differentiation between the Enterprise and Teams Tiers is now available as well, via license type.

Comprehensive details about the features included in each tier can be found on our [pricing page](https://flowfuse.com/pricing/).
