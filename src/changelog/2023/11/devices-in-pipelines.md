Building on our [previous release](https://flowfuse.com/blog/2023/08/flowfuse-1-11-release/#usability-improvements-to-device-management-%232294) that enabled the management of devices independently of instances. Now, the integration of individual devices into DevOps Pipelines is possible. This update marks a significant step towards more flexible and efficient device management within FlowFuse. In our ongoing efforts, we are also developing features to group devices, aiming to streamline and improve the overall device management experience.
