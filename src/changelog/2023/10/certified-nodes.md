Teams Tier customers can now leverage a curated selection of certfied Node-RED nodes, enhancing workflow efficiency and security.
- Quality Assurance: Each certified node undergoes testing, ensuring it's free from harmful components, aligning with our commitment to reliability.
- Proactive Security Measures: While prioritizing immediate resolutions for detected vulnerabilities, we maintain the discretion to revoke a node's certified status, ensuring system integrity. Affected customers will receive prompt notifications.
- Support: Assistance for certified nodes is provided, aiming for, but not promising, issue resolution.

How? You can find all certified nodes in your Node-RED palette manager or on the
[dedicated page](/certified-nodes/) on our website.
