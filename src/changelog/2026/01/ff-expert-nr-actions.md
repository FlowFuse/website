The FlowFuse Expert just got a lot more hands-on with your Node-RED editor:

* **Streamlined Node Installation:** When the Expert suggests a node module, it can now automatically open the Palette Manager and filter for the correct package, leaving you just one click away from installation.
* **Direct Flow Imports:** When the Expert provides demo flows, you no longer need to copy-paste JSON. The Expert can now inject those flows directly into your editor, ready for deployment.

These workflow integrations are just the start of our plans for the FlowFuse Expert. We’re excited to see how much time these save you!
