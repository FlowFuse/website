We continue to iterate on the FlowFuse Expert experience and today we have added new powers.

From within your chat, you can now ask questions like "Do I have any nodes installed that can send Emails?" or "Are my nodes up to date?" or any question related to your palette.

That may not seem like a lot, but it opens the door for adding debug messages (spolers!) and other context to your chat that will help you not only diagnose issues but tell you if the node you are using needs updating, why your flow is not working, or even suggest alterative nodes packages.

We hope these small life hacks make you more efficient and achieve more, in less time.
