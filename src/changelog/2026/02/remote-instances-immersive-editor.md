You can now access **Immersive Mode** when working with **Remote Instances**.

Immersive Mode gives you **at-a-glance instance stats** alongside the editor, while also enabling the **FlowFuse Expert** to help speed up development and debugging, especially when you’re working on the edge with remote devices.

Prefer the classic experience? The existing **plain** connection flow is still available: clicking the **Open Editor** selector will continue to open the editor in the original (non-immersive) mode.
