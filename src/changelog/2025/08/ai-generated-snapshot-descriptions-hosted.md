We’ve introduced a new feature: **AI-generated Snapshot Descriptions**.  
When creating a snapshot, you can now generate a concise description of what it contains and why it was created.

This makes it easier to understand the purpose of a snapshot at a glance, especially when working in a team or looking back weeks later.

### How it works

When creating a snapshot, you’ll see a new “Generate with AI” option.  
With one click, a suggested description is created for you, which you can accept as-is or edit before saving.

This feature is currently available for **hosted instances only**. Support for remote instances will follow shortly.
