Instances running the latest Node-RED version on FlowFuse v2.21.0 will now be able to export Node-RED SubFlows as Node-RED nodes.

This is done from the Node-RED editor using a custom sidebar.

The nodes are added to the Team's Library Custom Nodes and are installable into all of the Team's Node-RED instance from Catalogue generated from the Team Library.
