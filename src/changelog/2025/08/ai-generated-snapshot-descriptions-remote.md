We've extended **AI-generated snapshot descriptions** to **remote instances**.

Whether your remote instance is linked to an application or a hosted instance, you can now generate a smart, clear description of the snapshot with a single click.

### Two Flows, Same Outcome

Depending on how your remote instance is owned, the flow is slightly different:

![AI for application-owned remote instances](./images/device-llm-snapshot-description_application-owned.gif){data-zoomable}  
_AI for application-owned remote instances_

![AI for hosted-instance-owned remote](./images/device-llm-snapshot-description_instance-owned.gif){data-zoomable}  
_AI for hosted-instance-owned remote instances_

This rounds out our support for AI-generated snapshot descriptions.
