It happens! Sometimes things go wrong, but don't worry, we have you covered.

For Team and Enterprise customers on FlowFuse Cloud, we've improved the emails we send notifying you that something has gone wrong with one of your instances.

The emails now include more information about what has happened, including the most recent logs from Node-RED. We also include some tips as to what to do next, whether it was a code bug or a memory issue that triggered the problem.

We hope you never need to see these emails, but if you do, we hope they help you get back on track quickly.
