Last year, we announced the introducuction of Device Groups. For those that are not familiar with Device Groups, this feature enables users to logically group their devices so that they can be targeted in a DevOps Pipeline facilitating streamlined and efficient deployments across your fleet of devices.

Prior to this update, only 1 Device Group was allowed in a pipeline. Now, we are now permitting as many Device Groups as you wish to be chained in a pipeline, further streamlining your workflow.

This improvement not only saves time but also enhances the consistency and reliability of device management across your fleet.
