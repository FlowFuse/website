To help you manage resource utilization more effectively, we’ve introduced notifications to alert you when you’re nearing critical thresholds.

The new CPU and Memory notifications will notify you when usage exceeds 75% of capacity. This proactive alerting gives you the opportunity to take action before experiencing downtime or performance issues.

We hope this feature helps you avoid unexpected resource-related challenges with your applications.
