**Remote instances** can now make use of the new Timeline feature, providing a concise, chronological view of key activities within your Node-RED remote setup.

The Timeline and Snapshots are now grouped together under the Version History tab, simplifying the navigation of your remote instance's history.

This feature is only available to Enterprise license and Cloud Team users. Note that the Timeline can only be accessed at the remote instance level.
