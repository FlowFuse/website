# New Device Version History Events in FlowFuse 2.14

Starting with the 2.14 release, users will now be able to track additional events in the remote instance version history timeline. This enhancement improves traceability and provides deeper insights into remote instance state changes over time.

## New Trackable Events
- **Deploying Snapshots to Remote Instance via a Pipeline**
- **Deploying Snapshots through a Hosted Instance**
- **Snapshot Rollback**
- **Snapshot Create**

These events will be automatically recorded in the version history, allowing users to review and audit changes more effectively.
