Getting started with FlowFuse just became easier! When creating a new Node-RED instance, you can now import your existing flows directly during the setup process.

This new capability allows you to jumpstart your FlowFuse journey by bringing in flows you've already developed, whether they're from a local Node-RED installation, exported from another system, or shared by a colleague.

The import process is flexible and user-friendly:
- **File upload**: Simply select and upload a JSON file containing your flows
- **Direct paste**: Copy and paste flow JSON directly into a text area
- **Live preview**: See your flows rendered in real-time as you import them

The flows import step seamlessly integrates with the existing multi-step instance creation workflow. You can choose to start with a blueprint from our library or import your own flows - giving you multiple pathways to get productive quickly.

This enhancement is particularly valuable for teams looking to migrate existing Node-RED projects to FlowFuse or developers who want to quickly prototype with flows they've developed elsewhere.

To try it out, simply create a new instance and look for the new "Flows" step in the creation wizard!
