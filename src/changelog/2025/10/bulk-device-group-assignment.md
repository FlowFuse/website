Managing device groups for multiple Remote Instances is now easier to handle. Bulk management already existed but was
difficult to use efficiently at larger scale.

This update refines that process. You can select multiple Remote Instances from the team or application remote instances
pages and bulk assign them to device groups with fewer steps.

The improved workflow reduces friction when organizing devices by location, environment, or function.
