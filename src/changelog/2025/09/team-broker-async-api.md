As part of FlowFuse Cloud we have expanded the Async API documentation capabilities of the FlowFuse Team Broker.

You can now enable 24 hours of payload schema capture by clicking on the toggle

_Team Broker Schema Capture_

This will then update the payload Schema every 2 minutes with any new payloads discovered.

Once captured the Async API documentation can be generated by clicking on the "Open Schema" button.

This functionality was previously only available to 3rd party MQTT brokers using the MQTT Schema Agent, it is enabled on FlowFuse Cloud and will be available to Enterprise Licensed Self Hosted customers from v2.22.0.
