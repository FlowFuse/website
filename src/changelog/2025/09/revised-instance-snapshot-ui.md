Weâ€™ve redesigned how you interact with Hosted Instance **snapshots** by bringing all related actions into one place.  
Instead of jumping between different menus, you can now manage everything directly from a single consolidated view.

This update keeps all existing functionality, but makes it easier and faster to find and use.
