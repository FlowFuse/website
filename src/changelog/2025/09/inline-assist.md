More goodness has been added to the FlowFuse Assistant by way of inline suggestions as you type.
Initially, we have added support for the Function Node, Tables Query Node and the Dashboard Template Node.
It is contextually aware so will offer suggestions applicable to what it sees and what is already written.

### Let's see it in action
