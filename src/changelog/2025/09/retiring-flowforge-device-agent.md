When we changed company name from FlowForge to FlowFuse we continued to publish the Device Agent under the old package name `@flowforge/flowforge-device-agent` as well as the new package name `@flowfuse/device-agent`.

The current version 3.6.1 will be last release under the old package name.

The latest version can be found on npmjs.org [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flowfuse/device-agent)
