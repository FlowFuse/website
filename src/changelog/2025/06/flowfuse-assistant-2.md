We have: 
- Added a menu for quick access to the new features
- Improved the look and feel of the Flow Explainer

#### Updating the Assistant
If you are running Node-RED v4.x, head over to the Palette Manager, update the plugin and restart your instance.

If you are still running Node-RED v3.x we strogly recommend you update your stack to use Node-RED v4.x but you can
still manually update the plugin by adding `@flowfuse/nr-assistant` to the instance settings then restart it.
