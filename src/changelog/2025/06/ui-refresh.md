Weâ€™ve given the top navigation in FlowFuse a visual refresh to help move away from the dated look and feel.

Menus now use a clean white background, with updated colors, spacing, and transitions across the user menu, team switcher, and notification buttons. Mobile menus have also been cleaned up for better usability.

This is the first step in a broader UI modernization effort based on community feedback.
