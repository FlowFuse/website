We've expanded the **Performance** feature with an exciting new addition: Team Performance metrics.

**Team-Wide CPU Monitoring**: Get a complete overview of CPU usage across all hosted instances in your team,
helping you track and analyze resource allocation efficiently.

These enhancements are designed to improve operational visibility and resource management based on user feedback from
our community.
