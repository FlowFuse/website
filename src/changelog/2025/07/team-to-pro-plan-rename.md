We've renamed our Team tier to Pro tier to better reflect what it's truly designed for: using Node-RED professionally to build applications, replace and augment software in your organization, and scale professional Node-RED deployments.

The Pro plan empowers developers and engineers to move beyond collaboration and into production-ready industrial applications that optimize operations and drive real business value.

All existing Team plan subscribers will automatically transition to Pro. Your applications, instances, and team configurations remain exactly the same.

What's new:
- A name that better represents professional Node-RED application development
- Clearer positioning for organizations ready to scale their Node-RED implementations
