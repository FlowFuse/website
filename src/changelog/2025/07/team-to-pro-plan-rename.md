We've renamed our Team tier to Pro tier to better align with the plan's capabilities and target audience. This change provides clearer naming that better reflects the professional features and functionality included in this tier.

The rename affects:
- Pricing page terminology
- Plan references throughout the platform
- Documentation and marketing materials

All existing Team tier subscribers will automatically be transitioned to the Pro tier with no changes to their service or billing. The functionality, features, and pricing remain exactly the same - only the name has changed.

This update provides better clarity for users when choosing the right plan for their professional Node-RED development needs.
