We have added some new blueprints to FlowFuse Cloud to help users get started with a range of common manufacturing scenarios.

They are available to all users on FlowFuse Cloud. Additionally, upon request, all our Teams and Enterprise Self-Hosted customers gain access to this collection.

List of new Blueprints:
- [Andon Live](/blueprints/manufacturing/andon-live/)
- [CRUD for Mongo DB](/blueprints/getting-started/crud/)
- [5S Manufacturing checklist](/blueprints/manufacturing/5s-checklist/)
- [Performance Operator Terminal](/blueprints/manufacturing/performance-overview/)
