Hot on the heals of our recent onboarding improvements and streamlining, we 
have now introduced a new simpler and faster way of getting your devices
configured and connected to the FlowFuse platform.

Now, when you create a device on the platform, you will be offered a simple
"Setup command". Run this command in a terminal and the let the device
agent do all the hard work for you.
