In our continuous effort to enhance user experience and clarity, we are pleased to announce an update to our device mode terminology. Previously known as "Default Device" mode, we have now rebranded it as "Fleet Mode." This change aims to establish a clearer distinction from "Developer Mode," thereby streamlining the understanding of operational modes for our devices.

- **Fleet Mode**: Runs any target Snapshots defined. Blocks remote editing of device.
- **Developer Mode**: Blocks any new Target Snapshots running, but allows for remote editing on the Device.
