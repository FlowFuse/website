It happens! Sometimes things go wrong, but don't worry, we have you covered.

In FlowFuse V2.12, we have add some new email templates that provide better diagnostics for those rare occasions when things go wrong.

If you make a mistake when configuring your flows, or if there is a problem with the data you are sending, and you manage to crash your
instance, the new email templates will provide you with more information about what went wrong.

We hope you never need to see these emails, but if you do, we hope they help you get back on track quickly.
