Team-level views of all Pipelines and Bill of Materials have been added to provide a complete overview.

The Bill of Materials view shows which components and their versions across all Node-RED Devices &  Instances in the whole Team rather than at an Application level.

Similarly the Team Pipeline view shows all CI delivery pipelines in all the Applications in the Team, giving team members a quicker way to jump to a specific Pipeline.
