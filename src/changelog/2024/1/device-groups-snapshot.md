Four weeks ago, we launched the [Device Groups](../../2023/12/device-groups.md) feature, for our Enterprise customers. This innovation marked a significant step in simplifying device management within DevOps Pipelines. Now we enhacent the Device Groups functionality. 

With this update, the behavior of Device Groups has been refined to further streamline your workflow. Now, whenever a Snapshot is assigned to a Device Group, any newly added devices to that group will automatically receive the update. This ensures that all devices within the group are consistently synchronized with the latest changes, eliminating the need for manual updates. This improvement not only saves time but also enhances the consistency and reliability of device management across your fleet.
