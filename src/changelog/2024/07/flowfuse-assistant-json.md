The FlowFuse Assistant can now assist you by generating JSON.

Wherever you edit JSON in the Rich Monaco Editor you will see the "Ask the FlowFuse Assistant ðŸª„" code lens.
That includes the Inject Node, the Template Node and any contrib node that uses the built-in editor for writing JSON.

We think you will find this to be a great time saver and a good helper when you are unsure of the syntax.

Just ask for what you want and it does a decent job of figuring it out.

Here are some examples:


### Asking the assistant to generate JSON from within the `template` node

### Asking the assistant to generate JSON from within the `inject` node for the `payload` value

This is just the beginning of the FlowFuse Assistant's capabilities. Stay tuned!

_JSON Support is available in the FlowFuse Assistant plugin starting from version 0.1.1_
