We are excited to announce the first release of The FlowFuse Assistant, a new plugin for your Node-RED instances designed to enhance your development experience.

In this initial release, The FlowFuse Assistant can help you create function nodes for those times when a no-code solution is either not feasible or not possible.
Additionally, it works directly inside the Function Node editor right where you need it.

This is just the beginning. The FlowFuse Assistant will continue to evolve, with future updates bringing even more powerful features and enhancements.

Starting from today, FlowFuse users can try this out on their instances.
