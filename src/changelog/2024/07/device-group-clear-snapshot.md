An update to let you know you can now clear the target snapshot of a device group. This is small but useful feature that can help you manage your device groups more effectively.

For those unfamiliar with FlowFuse device groups, essentially, they permit you to deploy a snapshot to one or many devices via a pipeline in a single action. This is great for managing changes across a fleet of devices.

See the [device groups documentation](https://flowfuse.com/docs/user/device-groups) for more information on how to make use of device groups.
