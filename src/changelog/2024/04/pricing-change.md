We're updating our pricing model for the Enterprise and Teams tiers on FlowFuse Cloud, with changes taking effect immediately. All information is available on our [pricing page](https://flowfuse.com/pricing/).

The new pricing scheme is as follows:
- Starter Tier: Remains unchanged
- Teams Tier: Availability limited to Small $25 and Medium $50 Instances
- Enterprise Tier: Availability limited to Medium $50 and Large $250 Instances

We are also pleased to offer volume discounts. For more details, please [contact us](https://flowfuse.com/contact-us/).

## Important Note for Existing Teams

Teams that are currently subscribed to any tier and are using Instances will continue to be billed according to the previous pricing structure. Customers who have separate contracts with us will not be affected by these changes.
