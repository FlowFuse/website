From today we introduced simplification in the pricing structure for devices on FlowFuse Cloud, effective immediately. All information is available on our [pricing page](https://flowfuse.com/pricing/). 
The new pricing scheme is as follows:
- Starter Tier: No change
- Teams Tier: Devices are now priced at $25 each.
- Enterprise Tier: Devices are priced at $50 each.

We are also pleased to offer volume discounts. For more details, please [contact us](https://flowfuse.com/contact-us/).

## Important Note for Existing Teams

If a team currently in either tier already has devices (or has had devices in the past), any additions or removals of devices will be billed according to the previous pricing structure.
For teams without any prior device history, the addition of devices will be billed at the new rates.
