Effective immediately, instance sizes will now be directly tied to the FlowFuse tier. This update only impacts FlowFuse Cloud users.

Previously, users in the Starter Tier were limited to small instances. This will remain unchanged. However, in the Teams and Enterprise Tiers, users were required to select an instance size from small, medium, or large options. With the latest update, this selection process has been streamlined. All instances in the Teams Tier will now default to medium instances, and all instances in the Enterprise Tier will be large instances.

It's important to note that this change will not affect any instances that have already been created. For pricing related information, please visit our [pricing page](https://flowfuse.com/pricing/).
