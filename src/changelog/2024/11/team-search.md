A new search bar has been added that makes it quick and easy to find resources within your team.

This expands on the search available on the Applications summary view - but by moving to the top header, it's now available on all pages.

For this release, it searches your Applications, Instances and Devices. We'll be expanding its coverage in future iterations to include other resources in the team.
