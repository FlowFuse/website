To celibrate 25 years since the first release of the MQTT Specification we are happy announce a new MQTT Broker Service as part of FlowFuse Cloud.

The initial deployment is available to Enterprise Teams and allows up to 20 clients to connect to the broker. Each team has their own independant topic space and can set their own topic ACLs to control what clients can access.

This is currently only available to FlowFuse Cloud Enterprise Teams, but in future releases we will be making this feature available to Self Hosted customers with an Enterprise License. We will also add the ability to purchase batches of extra clients.
